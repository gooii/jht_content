                            <h2>Ngram Viewer</h2>

                            <p>The Ngram viewer charts the number of publications in the UK Medical Heritage Library
                                that contain specific words or phrases.</p>

                            <p>The viewer works by searching for a set of comma separated terms in the full texts
                                available, and plots on a chart, by year of publication the number of publications
                                containing those terms as a percentage of the total number of books/publications in the
                                collection.</p>

                            <p>The Ngram viewer provides insight into how the use of specific terms has changed over
                                time and provides a jumping off point for further searching of the UK Medical Heritage
                                Library.</p>

                            <h2>Hospital map</h2>
                            <p>This map shows hospitals on a map of Great Britain and makes it easy to search the UK
                                Medical Heritage Library for mentions of a hospital by name. You can zoom in and
                                zoom out of the map to view a specific area and the hospitals in that area. Using
                                the Histogram Filter you can filter the Hospitals based on the date they opened. You
                                can also navigate the list of hospitals through an alphabetical list of hospitals to
                                the left of the map.</p>

                            <p>In the list of hospitals to the left of the map you can see the number of results
                                found when searching the full texts in the UK Medical Heritage Library using the
                                hospital's name, and any alternative names by which is, or has been, known. Clicking
                                on a hospital name, will take you to the search results for that hospital name in
                                the collection.</p>

                            <h2>Timeline</h2>
                            <p>This timeline displays information on key events between the late 18th and early 20th
                                centuries, and displays them in relation to the number of texts in the UK Medical
                                Heritage Library published in each year. This offers a view of the collection in the
                                context of events contemporary with the publications. The timeline can be used to view
                                different types of events, with a focus on those that help put the content of the UK
                                Medical Heritage Library into context.</p>

                            <p>You can highlight a portion of the graph below the timeline using your mouse, to zoom
                                into the a specific period, and you can drag and drop the highlighted region on the
                                graph to move backwards or forwards along the timeline.</p>

                            <h2>Body Parts Dendrogram and Sunburst</h2>
                            <p>The Body Parts Dendrogram and Sunburst allow you to easily see the number of
                                publications in the UK Medical Heritage Library that mention specific parts of the human
                                anatomy, and to search for the relevant terms within the collection. In all cases the
                                diagrams have been constructed using a specially created hierarchy of terms used to
                                describe parts of the human anatomy.</p>

                            <p>The Sunburst diagrams offer a quick overview of the entire set of terms, and
                                make it easy to compare the number of publications that refer to different body parts
                                and systems. Clicking the labels that appear at the top of the diagram will search the
                                full texts in the UK Medical Heritage Library using the term displayed, any alternative
                                terms and related terms from the hierarchy.</p>

                            <p>The Dendrogram offers a different view of the same data with the ability to easily
                                navigate the hierarchy of terms, and once again carry out searches across the UK Medical
                                Heritage Library collection.</p>

                            <h2>Medical Conditions Dendrogram and Sunburst</h2>
                            <p>The Medical Conditions Dendrogram and Sunburst allow you to easily see the
                                number of publications in the UK Medical Heritage Library that mention specific medical
                                conditions, and to search for the relevant terms within the collection. In all cases the
                                diagrams have been constructed using a specially created hierarchy of terms used to
                                describe medical conditions, generally grouped by the anatomical systems with which they
                                are related.</p>

                            <p>The Sunburst diagrams offer a quick overview of the entire set of terms, and
                                make it easy to compare the number of publications that refer to different medical
                                conditions. Clicking the labels that appear at the top of the diagram will search the
                                full texts in the UK Medical Heritage Library using the term displayed, any alternative
                                terms and related terms from the hierarchy. In particular historical terms for specific
                                conditions that are not longer used are included in searches.</p>

                            <p>The Dendrogram offers a different view of the same data with the ability to easily
