                            <h2>Ngram Viewer</h2>

                            <p>The Ngram viewer charts the number of publications in the UK Medical Heritage Library that contain specific words or phrases.</p>

                            <p>The viewer works by searching for a set of comma separated terms in the full texts available, and plots on a chart, by year of publication the number of publications containing those terms as a percentage of the total number of books&#47;publications in the collection.</p>

                            <p>The Ngram viewer provides insight into how the use of specific terms has changed over time and provides a jumping&#45;off point for further searching of the UK Medical Heritage Library.</p>

							
							
                            <h2>Hospital map</h2>
                            
							<p>This map is based on the Hospital Records Database developed by the Wellcome Library and The National Archives.  It shows the location of a subset of hospitals that existed between 1870 and 1914 on a map of Great Britain and makes it easy to search the UK Medical Heritage Library for mentions of a hospital by name.</p> 
							
							<p>You can zoom in and zoom out of the map to view a specific area and the hospitals in that area. Using the Histogram Filter you can filter the Hospitals based on the date they opened. You can also navigate the list of hospitals through an alphabetical list of hospitals to the left of the map.</p>
							
                            <p>In the list of hospitals to the left of the map you can see the number of results found when searching the full texts in the UK Medical Heritage Library using the hospital&#39;s name, and any alternative names by which is, or has been, known. Clicking on a hospital name will take you to the search results for that hospital name in the collection.</p>

                            <h2>Timeline</h2>
							
							
                            <p>This timeline displays information on key events between the late 18th and early 20th centuries, and displays them in relation to the number of texts in the UK Medical Heritage Library published in each year. This offers a view of the collection in the context of events contemporary with the publications. The timeline can be used to view different types of events, with a focus on those that help put the content of the UK Medical Heritage Library into context.</p>

							<p>The different categories of events were chosen in consultation with the Academic Advisory Group with the actual events themselves being populated by a team of expert consultants led by staff from King&#39;s College London.</p>
							
                            <p>You can highlight a portion of the graph below the timeline using your mouse, to zoom
                                into the a specific period, and you can drag&#45;and&#45;drop the highlighted region on the
                                graph to move backwards or forwards along the timeline.</p>

								
								
                            <h2>Body Parts Dendrogram and Sunburst</h2>
							
                            <p>The Body Parts Dendrogram and Sunburst allow you to easily see the number of publications in the UK Medical Heritage Library that mention specific parts of the human anatomy, and to search for the relevant terms within the collection.</p>
							
                            <p>The visualisations were developed as a result of consultations with prospective users who felt that it would be useful for inexperienced users to have a way of exploring the texts by browsing a list of parts of the human anatomy organised as a hierarchy. The term lists were developed by a team of external experts led by staff from Kings College London and were subject to peer review and refinement by members of the academic community including the academic advisory group. </p>
							
                            <p>The Sunburst diagrams offer a quick overview of the entire set of terms, and make it easy to compare the number of publications that refer to different body parts and systems. Clicking the labels that appear at the top of the diagram will search the full texts in the UK Medical Heritage Library using the term displayed, any alternative terms and related terms from the hierarchy.</p>

                            <p>The Dendrogram offers a different view of the same data with the ability to easily navigate the hierarchy of terms, and once again carry out searches across the UK Medical Heritage Library collection.</p>

							<p>The Medical Conditions Dendrogram and Sunburst allow you to easily see the number of publications in the UK Medical Heritage Library that mention specific medical conditions, and to search for the relevant terms within the collection.</p>
							
							<p>The visualisations were developed as a result of consultations with prospective users who felt that it would be useful for inexperienced users to have a way of exploring the texts by browsing a list of medical conditions, generally grouped by the anatomical systems with which they are related. The term lists were developed by a team of external experts led by staff from King&#39;s College London and were subject to peer review and refinement by members of the academic community including the academic advisory group. The lists have to potential to be modified or expanded in future, for example by the addition of further alternative names for conditions &#40;e.g. scarlet fever, scarlatina&#41;.</p>

                            <p>The Sunburst diagrams offer a quick overview of the entire set of terms, and make it easy to compare the number of publications that refer to different medical conditions. Clicking the labels that appear at the top of the diagram will search the full texts in the UK Medical Heritage Library using the term displayed, any alternative terms and related terms from the hierarchy. In particular historical terms for specific conditions that are not longer used are included in searches.</p>

                            <p>The Dendrogram offers a different view of the same data with the ability to easily navigate the hierarchy of terms, and once again carry out searches across the UK Medical Heritage Library collection.</p>
								
							<h2>Image Wall</h2>
                            
                            <p>You can access the Image Wall from your search results by clicking the Image Wall tab, from along the row of tabs across the top of the results. The illustrations related to the publications in the results will be displayed in a tiled&#45;mosaic fashion.
							Placing the mouse over an illustration will cause it to flip over, displaying the related bibliographic data for the parent publication. Clicking on any illustration in the Image Wall will open this publication in the Viewer at the relevant page.<p>

                            <p>You can also preview illustrations from a publication directly in the main search results list, by clicking the &lsquo;Show Images&rsquo; link under any illustrated result. As with the Image Wall, clicking any image will open this publication in the Viewer at the relevant page.</p>  							

							<p>The wall of images contains images extracted from the corpus of texts which make up the collection.  The images were extracted using a specially written routine which seeks to limit the number of &lsquo;false&rsquo; images being identified as a result of imperfections in the OCR process such as tears or marks on the pages, library stamps and manuscript annotation and image &lsquo;bleed through&rsquo; from the obverse page.  For this reason, some actual images may well have been missed during the extraction process.</p>
