                &#40;UKMHL&#41;</a>
                is the culmination of a three&#45;year project between Jisc, the Internet Archive, the
                Wellcome Library and nine other partner institutions to digitise more than 15 million pages
                in over 66,000 works. The Wellcome Library have provided their entire 19th Century
                collection, while the other participating libraries have contributed selections from their
                special collections, to encompass a broad and diverse range of relevant publications from
                the period.</p>

            <p>Sporting full colour page images, PDF downloads and searchable OCR full text for all
                publications, The UKMHL collection is a valuable resource. The subject areas covered are
                broad and include topics such as consumer health, sport and fitness, food and nutrition as
                well as medicine and medical practices, providing a valuable resource for study in the
                medical humanities and beyond.</p>

            <p>The &ldquo;Visualising Medical History&rdquo; sister&#45;project has created powerful
                visualisation tools unique to the UKMHL collection, which researchers can use to search the
                content in new and hitherto untapped ways.
                <br/>
                The UK Medical Heritage Library collection is the first open access collection for
                Historical Texts and it is currently hosted in a <a
                        href="https://ukmhl.historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk/home">separate &ldquo;Labs&rdquo;
                    area.</a> Historical Texts Labs has been created to enable researchers, students and
                teachers to test out and feedback on new features prior to their inclusion in the main
                service. The UK Medical Heritage Library collection is scheduled for integration into the
                main Historical Texts service in 2017, so it will then be cross&#45;searchable alongside
                EEBO, ECCO and the BL collections. There will also be a permanent open access portal for the
                collection.</p>
