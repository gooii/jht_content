            <p>The <a href="/home">UK Medical Heritage Library &#40;UKMHL&#41;</a> is the culmination of a three&#45;year project between Jisc, the Internet Archive, the Wellcome Library and nine other partner institutions to digitise more than 15 million pages in over 66,000 works. The Wellcome Library have provided their entire 19th Century collection, while the other participating libraries have contributed selections from their special collections, to encompass a broad and diverse range of relevant publications from the period.</p>
			
			<p>The contributing libraries are&#58;</p>

			<li><a href="/rcse">Royal College of Surgeons of England</a></li>
			<li><a href="/rcpe">Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh</a></li>

            <p>Sporting full colour page images, PDF downloads and searchable OCR full text for all publications, The UKMHL collection is a valuable resource. The subject areas covered are broad and include topics such as consumer health, sport and fitness, food and nutrition as well as medicine and medical practices, providing a valuable resource for study in the medical humanities and beyond.</p>
			
            <p>The &ldquo;Visualising Medical History&rdquo; sister&#45;project has created powerful visualisation tools unique to the UKMHL  collection, which researchers can use to search the content in new and hitherto untapped ways. You can also <a href="/info">read more about how the visualisations were created.</a> 
			<br />
			The UK Medical Heritage Library collection is the first open access collection for Historical Texts and it is currently hosted in a <a href="/home">separate &ldquo;Labs&rdquo; area.</a></p> 
			<p>Historical Texts Labs has been created to enable researchers, students and teachers to test out and feedback on new features prior to their inclusion in the main service. The UK Medical Heritage Library collection is scheduled for integration into the main Historical Texts service in 2017, so it will then be cross&#45;searchable alongside EEBO, ECCO and the BL collections. There will also be a permanent open access portal for the collection.</p>
