			<p>This accessibility statement applies to <a href="https://ukmhl.historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk" target="_self">https://ukmhl.historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk</a>.</p>
			
			<p>This website is run by Jisc. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to&#58;</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser plugins</li>
				<li>Zoom in up to 200&#37; without the text spilling off the screen.</li>
				<li>Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
				<li>Listen to most of the website using a screen reader &#40;tested using NVDA&#41;</li>
				<li>Skip to main content on all but one page</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

			<h2>How accessible this website is</h2>
			
			<p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible&#58;</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Although we have made recent improvements to the site, the viewer still has some issues. If you are having difficulties, the best solution may be to open the item in the viewer and download the PDF&#47;text files from the download menu. This can be operated by keyboard and even when styling is turned off for the viewer page, the buttons still operate. This would also be our recommendation if you need to use the viewer at a magnification above 200%.</li>
				<li>Quite a few of the visualisation tools are not operable by keyboard. The following tools can be used by keyboard only&#58; NGram Viewer, Wall of Images and, with some caveats, the Dendrogram</li>
				<li>It is not possible to operate the histogram using the keyboard but the same result can be achieved using the advanced search date filter, which can be operated by keyboard.</li>
				<li>Please note that certain drop down menus in the tool bar and advanced search can only be operated by tab rather than arrow keys.</li>
				<li>The site is not fully usable in the portrait orientation on a small screen device. We recommend viewing the site in landscape orientation if possible. If this is not possible, we recommend viewing search results in the portrait orientation and then downloading the PDF from the viewer rather than trying to operate the viewer in portrait orientation.</li>
				<li>When you view some of our pages at or above 200&#37; zoom, although the text reflows, parts of some images and videos are lost off the right&#45;hand side of the page. Some of these images can be viewed as full page images &#40;e.g. in the Quick Reference Guide&#41; so check if they can be clicked on to enlarge them that way. An alternative source for our support videos is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jischistoricaltexts" target="_self">the Historical Texts YouTube channel</a>.</li>
				<li>We have very few PDFs on the UK Medical Heritage Library Site. The Quick Reference Guide PDF is also available in HTML format.</li>
				<li>Please note that is also possible to access all the content of the UK Medical Heritage Library via the main Historical Texts platform even if you are not a subscriber.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Technical information about this website&#39;s accessibility</h2>
			
			<p>Jisc is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies &#40;Websites and Mobile Applications&#41; &#40;No. 2&#41; Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
			
			<h2>Compliance status</h2>
			
			<p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21" target="_self">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below.</p>
			
			<h2>Non&#45;accessible content</h2>
			
			<p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
			
			<h3>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
			
			<!--in this section list: accessibility problems, which of the WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria the problem fails on, when you plan to fix the problem-->
			
			
			<p>A small number of our pages lack headings which makes it harder for those using screen readers to navigate. This fails WCAG 2.1. success criterion 1.3.1 &#40;Info and Relationships&#41;. We plan to ensure that all pages in the new site we are designing have appropriately used headings on all pages.</p>
			
			<p>If styling is removed from the viewer page, the content is no longer fully usable. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.2 &#40;Meaningful sequence&#41;. The best solution to this is to download the PDF&#47;text and read it outside the viewer. This operation can also be carried out from the page with the styling turned off.</p>
			
			<p>The site was originally designed with only desktop use in mind, and although improvements have been made to increase the usability on smaller screen tablet&#47;mobile devices, it is still not really possible to use the site properly in a portrait orientation. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.4 &#40;Orientation&#41;. We plan to ensure that the new site we are designing is usable in both portrait and landscape orientation from the start.</p>
			
			<p>When the site is zoomed in to 200&#37; or more, although text reflows as required, some images and videos &quot;fall off&quot; the right&#45;hand side of the page rather than resizing. When using the viewer at a magnification of above 200&#37; it becomes very difficult to use the content of the side panels and some of this is lost. These fail WCAG criterion 1.4.10 &#40;Reflow&#41;.  Some workarounds for this issue are listed earlier in the document. We plan to use a fully fluid layout for the new site we are designing which will eliminate these issues.</p>
			
			<p>A number of the visualisations and the medical events on the timeline cannot be operated by keyboard which fails WCAG criterion 2.1.1 &#40;Keyboard&#41;. We have made the visualisations as accessible by keyboard as possible on the current platform. The dendrogram tabbing can behave in an unexpected way, appearing to move backwards. This is due to how the nodes are created on the fly. As the visualisations were created by a third party, we are unable to easily change this. We plan to investigate designing new visualisations which will be more accessible as we integrate the UK Medical Heritage content into the new platform we are building. Please note that the zoom in and zoom out keys in the viewer cannot be operated by keyboard when using the viewer in Chrome. A workaround for this is to use the viewer in FireFox which does not suffer from this issue. It is also not possible to operate the histogram using the keyboard but the same result can be achieved using the advanced search date filter, which can be operated by keyboard.</p>
			
			<p>A &quot;Skip to main content,&quot; link is not currently available in the viewer, and some of the visualisation pages which fails WCAG criterion 2.4.1. &#40;Bypass Blocks&#41;. These have been added to all other pages, but technical difficulties prevent it from being added to the third party viewer and visualisation pages. We plan to ensure that all pages in the new platform have bypass blocks in place.</p>
			
			<p>Most pages have a unique title but currently the search results page and browse pages have the identical title of &quot;results.&quot; This makes distinguishing these pages for those using a screen reader more difficult and fails WCAG 2.1 criterion 2.4.2 &#40;Page titled&#41;. We plan to ensure that all pages have unique titles in the new platform we are building.</p>
			
			<p>On some pages, there are links with the same text that go to different places. This can be confusing for screen reader users and fails WCAG criterion 2.4.4 &#40;Link Purpose In Context&#41;. We plan to differentiate these links either by updating the text or using aria&#45;labelledby by 23 September 2020. For those where this is not possible due to the structure of the site, we will change we way we create menus in the new site we are designing.</p>
			
			<p>We are aware that although improvements have been made to the navigability of the site by keyboard&#47;screen reader, it is still sometimes difficult to see where you are which fails WCAG criterion 2.4.7 &#40;Focus visible&#41;. We are also aware of at least one automated fail for this criterion. We plan to use a more consistent design pattern which will make focus states more perceivable in the new site we are designing.</p>
			
			<h3>Disproportionate burden</h3>
			
			<!--details of items that cannot be fixed and justification could maybe have h4 sub headings-->
			
			<p>We are not claiming a disproportionate burden for any area of improvements that are required.</p>
			
			<h3>Content that&#39;s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
			
			<!--details of content not covered by PSBAR. Could maybe have h4 sub headings-->
			
			<h4>PDFs and other documents</h4>
			
			<p>The site only uses one PDF document &#40;Quick Reference Guide&#41; but this information is also available in HTML format.</p>
			
			<p>The accessibility regulations <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made" target="_self">do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018</a> if they’re not essential to providing our services. Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards or the information will be provided in a more accessible HTML format.</p>
			
			<h2>What we&#39;re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
			
			<p>We plan to merge some features of the UK Medical Heritage Library site into a new platform we are building for Historical Texts over the next three years, including a package of work on redesigning the visualisations to make them more accessible and moving to the use of the <a href="https://universalviewer.io" target="_self">Universal Viewer</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
			
			<p>This statement was prepared on 8 September 2020. It was last reviewed on 15 September 2020.</p>
			
			<p>This website was last tested on 15 September 2020. The test was carried out members of the Historical Texts team.</p>
			
			<p>We selected several pages that represented different types of content on the site ensuring there were images, links and forms across the selection. We tested&#58;</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>UK Medical Heritage Library home page</li>
				<li>Search results page</li>
				<li>Viewer</li>
				<li>Support home page</li>
				<li>Quick Reference guide page</li>
				<li>About home page</li>
				<li>Browse page</li>
				<li>A selection of the visualisation pages</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>We used a mixture of manual testing &#40;including using NVDA&#41; and automated testing using both <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension" target="_self">WAVE</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-accessibility/efcfolpjihicnikpmhnmphjhhpiclljc" target="_self">SiteImprove.</a></p>
