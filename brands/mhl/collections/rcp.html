                    <div class="subLeft">
                        <p>A professional membership body for physicians, its library was founded in 1518. As well as
                            publications on health and disease, the collection covers topics as diverse as zoology,
                            architecture, travel, history, poetry and religion, donated by those physicians who had
                            interests beyond medicine. </p>
                        <p>Approximately 17,000 books and pamphlets were within the date range of this project.
                            Highlights include the history of the College, and items written by its fellows and members
                            including examination papers and lecture transcripts. Other strengths include digitised
                            books by Alfred Swaine Taylor, the 'father of British toxicology', debates surrounding the
                            risks of vaccination, and occupational health in diverse industries such as mining and
                            pottery. Immunology and microbiology is represented through the works of the Nobel Prize
                            winners &Eacute;lie Metchnikoff and Paul Ehrlich. The collection also highlights the social
                            history of the period: not least the practice of visiting health resorts documented through
                            many travel guides for retreats and resorts like Bath or the Riviera. The RCP digitised
                            collection includes some of the earliest works by women studying to become physicians such
                            as Ann Elizabeth Clark, Edith Pechey-Phipson, and Sophia Jex-Blake. Another strength of the
                            collection is the range of languages. While the majority of the items are in English, there
                            are also books and pamphlets available in French, German, Latin, Spanish, Italian, Arabic,
                            Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch and Tamil.</p>
