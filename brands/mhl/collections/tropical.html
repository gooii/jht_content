                        <p>The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is one of the world's leading centres for
                            research and postgraduate education in public and global health. </p>
                        <p>Founded in 1899, as the London School of Tropical Medicine, by Sir Patrick Manson, it is
                            believed that a Library service was available to students from the beginning. However, the
                            majority of the volumes which make up its historical collection were purchased when the
                            School expanded to become the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. This was made
                            possible via a grant from the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, awarded in 1927. This
                            collection has been supplemented by donations from a variety of prominent friends of the
                            School, including Andrew Balfour, Shirley Murphy and Arthur Newsholme. A second collection
                            of items on smallpox and vaccination, collected by Dr Richard Reece, a medical inspector
                            with the Local Government Board, was sold to the School on his death. Reece's collection was
                            described by the British Medical Journal as 'the most complete library in this country of
                            the old literature of small-pox, variolation and vaccination.'</p>
                        <p>Together, the collections outline the history of tropical medicine and public health. They
                            contain many volumes from the Victorian age of exploration and sanitary improvements, with
                            particular strengths in smallpox, vaccination, cholera, malaria, and public health, and
                            contain a fine collection of pamphlet material, as well as larger texts. It was decided that
                            all items meeting the Medical Heritage Library criteria would be selected for
                            digitisation. </p>
