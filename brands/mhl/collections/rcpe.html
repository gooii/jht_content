                    <h2>Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh</h2>

                    <div class="subLeft">
                        <p>The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh was founded by Royal Charter in 1681. Its
                            library and Archives now holds over 60,000 books, almost 1500 journals and over 300
                            externally deposited manuscript collections.</p>
                        <p>During the nineteenth century, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh was one of the
                            leading medical institutions in Great Britain. Like other medical corporations it had to
                            adjust to the changes the century brought like the 1858 Medical Act, the enhanced value
                            placed on basic scientific training of medical students, the development of modern
                            examination structures and increasing specialisation. To support its role, the College
                            collected widely and invested in a new library to house its growing book collection. It
                            became the leading medical library in Scotland and regularly bought monographs to meet the
                            contemporary medical information needs of its fellows. </p>
                        <p>Scientific medicine, public health, sociology and other disciplines all feature and as might
                            be expected, the collection contains works by many of the leading figures of the time
                            including Chadwick, Christison, Hahneman, Hughes-Bennett, Koch, Lister, Pasteur, Simpson,
                            Syme, Tuke and Virchow. The College has carefully looked after its 19th century collection
                            which was catalogued to modern standards in the 21st century thanks to Wellcome Trust
                            Research Resources funding. </p>
