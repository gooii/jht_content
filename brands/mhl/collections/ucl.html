                            <p>University College London was founded in 1826 in Bloomsbury and its General Library
                                opened in 1849. The main Library currently holds collections in the Arts & Humanities,
                                with a large Science Library close by. A further 14 specialist libraries support UCL&#39;s
                                teaching and research across its campuses, including several that provide services to
                                both UCL and the National Health Service. The Special Collections and Digital
                                Collections are a rich source of manuscripts, archives and rare books.</p>
