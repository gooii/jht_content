                    <h2>King's College London</h2>

                    <div class="subLeft">
                        <p>King's College London was founded in 1829 and opened in 1831: medicine was taught from the
                            outset. A decade later, King's opened a new hospital, King's College Hospital, in nearby
                            Portugal Street. This relocated to its current premises in Denmark Hill in south London, in
                            1913. The already merged medical schools of Guy's and St Thomas'
                            Hospitals became part of King's in 1998. Particular strengths include the study of nursing,
                            via the Nightingale School of Nursing, dental education, and psychiatry: the world-renowned
                            Institute of Psychiatry merged with King's in 1997. </p>
                        <p>King's contribution to the UK Medical Heritage Library comprises 2,000 medical books,
                            pamphlets and periodicals out of a total of 17,600 medical publications held in its Foyle
                            Special Collections Library and reflects this rich tradition of medical teaching and
                            research. Highlights include items from the historical book collection of the Institute of
                            Psychiatry (founded 1923) and the historical library collection of the Foreign and
                            Commonwealth Office (founded 1782, transferred to King's 2007). </p>
                        <p>The historical book collections of the medical schools of St Thomas' Hospital (founded 1551),
                            Guy's Hospital (founded 1726) and King's College Hospital (founded 1840) are well
                            represented, as is the library of the Guy's Hospital Physical Society (active
                            1771-1852).</p>
                        <p>King's collections are strong in many areas, and subjects covered include psychiatry and the
                            care of the mentally ill; neurology; public health and sanitation, with a particular
                            emphasis on public health administration in the former British Empire; tropical medicine;
                            anatomy; surgery; general medicine and pathology; obstetrics and gynaecology; and popular
                            medicine.</p>
