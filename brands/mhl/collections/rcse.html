                        <p>The Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS) is an independent professional body committed
                            to promoting and advancing the highest standards of surgical care for patients. Its origins
                            lie in the Company of Barber-Surgeons, established by Act of Parliament in 1540. </p>
                        <p>Serious collecting of books at RCS only began in 1807, initially to support the work of
                            curators of the

                            <a href="https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/museums/hunterian">Hunterian Museum</a>. By the close of
                            the 19th century, however, it was widely recognised that the RCS possessed one of the finest
                            libraries for the medical sciences in Europe. Today the library holds approximately 75,000
                            books from the fifteenth century onwards, 30,640 pamphlets dating from the sixteenth
                            century, and around 2,000 runs of periodicals, including early journals dating back to the
                            seventeenth century. </p>
                        <p>A key focus for the UK Medical Heritage Library digitisation are examples of the tracts and
                            pamphlets, a discrete collection that comprises 30,640 items dating from the sixteenth
                            century up to the early twentieth century. Each item is well catalogued online thanks to
                            grants from the Wellcome Trust's Research Resources programme. Around 21,800 items were
                            digitised for this project, reflecting the breadth and depth of the collection's coverage.
                            Grounds for exclusion included size, physical condition or age. </p>
                        <p>Subject scope is very wide, covering all branches of medicine and some of the natural
                            sciences, in particular natural history, anthropology and palaeontology, which were the
                            interests of the contemporary curators of the College museum. There is material to support
                            research into the beginnings of anaesthesia, antisepsis, microbiology, forensic medicine,
                            demography and epidemiology; the reform of the medical and dental professions; military
                            medicine; and, of course, the development of specific surgical techniques. Moreover,
                            pamphlets on sanitation and sewerage, on workhouse hospitals and on the Contagious Diseases
                            Acts illustrate the wider history of public health and social reform.</p>
