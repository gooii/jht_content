                    <h2>University of Glasgow</h2>

                    <div class="subLeft">
                        <p>The University of Glasgow is the fourth oldest University in the United Kingdom, founded in
                            1451. The study of medicine was first mentioned in 1637 but the modern medical school came
                            into being when William Cullen was appointed Professor of Medicine in 1751. The University
                            also has a School of Veterinary Medicine, founded in 1862, and the Dental School, founded in
                            1878, is the second largest in the UK.</p>
                        <p>The Library’s general medical collections are particularly strong in anatomy, surgery,
                            clinical medicine, public health, sanitation, and homeopathic medicine. The University was
                            heavily involved with the development of a health care system in Glasgow, and in particular,
                            with the treatment of mental illness and infectious diseases. The Library’s medical
                            collections reflect this history. There is also a diverse and extensive collection of
                            historical material ranging from vaccination, medical botany, and the treatment of
                            consumption and cholera, to areas such as psychology, health spas, cookery, and alchemy.
                            Within the University Library’s Special Collections there are outstanding resources for
                            research on the history of medicine generally, and in the areas of anatomy, obstetrics and
                            gynaecology in particular, largely owing to the superb library of William Hunter
                            (1718-1783), a leading eighteenth century anatomist.</p>
                        <p>The University of Glasgow identified around 7,300 titles as part of the UK Medical Heritage
                            Library Project, of which around 5,000 were sent for digitisation. Exclusions included
                            volumes that were outsize or where their condition made them unsuitable for scanning or for
                            transportation. There were a small number of titles not sent which fell within the scope of
                            the project but which are part of the Library’s Hunterian Collection and were judged too
                            valuable to be released. All of the original print materials can be consulted in the
                            Library.</p>
