                <h2>University of Bristol</h2>

                <div class="subLeft">
                    <p>The University of Bristol began life as University College, Bristol, in 1876. The medical
                        collections owe their origin to the affiliation (1879) and subsequent merger (1893) of the
                        Bristol Medical School (founded in 1833) with the University College. The collections include
                        libraries of hospitals, practitioners and medical reading societies in Bristol and Bath, two
                        important centres of healing in the nineteenth century and earlier. This is reflected in the
                        inclusion in the project of material from the Spas Collection, a leading collection in its field
                        relating to waters.</p>

                    <p>The medical holdings account for perhaps 10% of Bristolâ€™s pre-twentieth-century rare book
                        holdings and the selection digitised perhaps a little over 5% of the medical titles in the long
                        nineteenth century covered by the project. Online catalogue records are available for only a
                        proportion of the medical holdings, which reduced the number of titles that could be included in
                        the project. As the re-cataloguing of the nineteenth and twentieth century medical special
                        collection has been following the shelf order of the collection, this will have resulted in an
                        over-representation of early categories in the Cunningham classification scheme. Late eighteenth
                        century works have been more comprehensively re-catalogued and should have less obvious bias.
                        The second limiting factor was the need for materials to be in robust condition to withstand
                        travel and the digitisation process, and this factor resulted in exclusions right across the
                        subject range, with no obvious subject bias.</p>

                        <strong>Access to the originals:</strong><br/>
                        Original materials are accessible through the University Library's Special Collections. The
                        <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/">Library Search</a> facility records thousands of medical texts
                        but, until re-cataloguing is complete, researchers may need to check the Medical Library card
                        catalogue. Consultation is free of charge but appointments must be made and proof of identity
                        must be shown.
