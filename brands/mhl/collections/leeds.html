                        <p>With over 3 million printed items, 2 million manuscript and archival documents, the
                            University of Leeds Library underpins a wide range of research in the medical humanities,
                            including work on the history of science and medicine, medical ethics and social
                            history.</p>
                        <p>The
                            <a href="http://library.leeds.ac.uk/special_collections_list/144/history_and_philosophy_of_science%2520-%2520atoz-nav-h">Health
                                Sciences Historical Collection</a> has its origins in the library of the Leeds Medical
                            School, founded in 1831. In the 1860s, the library of the Leeds General Infirmary was also
                            transferred to the Medical School, enriching the collection with volumes dating from the
                            sixteenth to the nineteenth century, mostly in English but also key French, German and Latin
                            texts. The Medical School collection was then added to that of the fore-runner of the
                            University, the Yorkshire College of Science, when the two bodies merged in 1874. </p>
                        <p>The Health Sciences Historical Collection includes a number of manuscripts, including
                            personal papers associated with prominent Leeds medical practitioners from the eighteenth to
                            the twentieth century. The works of local authors with national reputations such as the
                            surgeons, William Hey (1736-1819) and later Thomas Pridgen Teale (1801-1867) are represented
                            as well as works by leaders of the profession such as the surgeon Astley Cooper (1768-1841).
                            The material associated with Yorkshire is rare if not unique and such material is important
                            in building a national picture of developments in areas such as public health.</p>

                        <p>A unique contribution from Leeds for this project is the inclusion of books from the large
                            <a href="http://library.leeds.ac.uk/special-collections-cookery-collection">Cookery
                                Collection</a> since there is a close relationship with the themes of nutrition,
                            medicine and health. These works frequently include material on informal treatments and
                            medication as well as incorporating other content relating to medicine and health. The depth
                            and breadth of the collection means that the material has far reaching impact beyond the
                            subject of cookery. It includes many works on food production, on food's medicinal uses, on
                            gardening and other food-related topics. A consistent feature of the Cookery Collection is
                            its inclusion of long sequences of editions of outstandingly popular works through which it
                            is possible to trace the evolution of the text over time and thus to observe innovation and
                            changes in taste and fashion, as well as developments in the book trade. Around 10% of the
                            Cookery Collection has been digitised as part of the UK Medical Heritage Library project.
