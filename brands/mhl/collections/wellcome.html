                                <p>The Wellcome Library - part of Wellcome Collection - is one of the world&#39;s major
                                    resources for the study of histories and cultures of medicine. It is developing a
                                    world-class online collection for the history of medicine by digitising a
                                    substantial proportion of its holdings and making the content freely available on
                                    the web: collections already digitised include the

                                <p> The Library interprets 'medicine' quite broadly, to include related sciences,
                                    consumer health, sport and fitness, food and nutrition, as well as medical
                                    practices, such as mesmerism, phrenology and hydrotherapy, that have since fallen
                                    out of favour, but which were important in their time. The Wellcome Library has so
                                    far contributed over 12,000 monographs to the UK Medical Heritage Library, and will
                                    continue to add titles by the thousands over the next few years.</p>
