				<h3>Ignatius Sancho</h3>
				
				<p>Born 1729</p>
				<p>Died 14th December 1780</p>
				<p>Brought to England at around the age of 2, he worked for three sisters in Greenwich who refused to educate him.&sup1; He was encouraged in his education by the 2nd Duke of Montagu who lived nearby.&sup2; He was employed as a butler and then valet by the Duke&#39;s family until 1773. He then opened a grocery shop with his wife &sup3; using money gifted to him by the Montagus and as a financially independent man he was able to vote in the 1774 election.&#8308; He died in 1780 of complications from gout.&sup1; Two years after his death a collection of his letters were published. <strong>This collection of letters can be found in the Historical Texts Platform.</strong></p>

				<h3>Francis Barber</h3>
				
				<p>Born &quot;Some time around 1735&quot;&sup1;</p>
				<p>Died 1801</p>
				<p>Francis Barber was born in Jamaica and brought across to England by his master, Colonel Richard Bathurst, who paid for his education in a school in Yorkshire. He was then sent to work as a valet for Dr Samuel Johnson in 1752 following the death of his wife.&sup2; In 1754 Barber’s owner died leaving him £12 and his freedom. He ran away to sea and Dr Johnson later arranged for his discharge from the Navy and further education for him.&sup2; Barber was one of two people present at the death of the famed writer and was given an annual sum of £71 in Johnson’s will.&sup3;</p>
				<p>Frances Barber is mentioned in James Boswell&#39;s book regarding the life of Samuel Johnson which can be found in the Historical Texts Platform. It should be noted that he is not the author of the book More Last Words of Dr Johnson with the misleading author name Francis, Barber,&sup3; although this book is also present in Historical Texts.</p>

				<h3>David Spens</h3>
				
			  <p>David Spens was an enslaved African man brought across from Grenada. He was baptised into the Christian faith on 10 September 1769 and soon after was set to be sold as a slave in the West Indies.&sup1; On discovering this David ran away and sought help from his neighbours who raised money to fight his consequent arrest in court. The story is captured in a footnote on page 545 of the following text&#58;</p>

				<h3>Prince John Naimbanna</h3>
				
				<p>John Naimbanna was an African prince who was sent to England in 1791 to receive an education and to study Christianity. His father, King Naimbanna, was friends with abolitionist Granville Sharp.&sup1; During his time in England he converted to Christianity and was noted for his desire for knowledge. He apparently studied for 8&#45;10 hours a day.&sup2; He returned home following the death of his father but fell ill on the journey and died hours after he arrived home. On his death bed he apparently urged his brothers to oppose the slave trade and his aptitude for study was used by abolitionists in their arguments against slavery.&sup1;</p>
				
				<p>An account of the life, character and death of the prince can be found on our Historical Texts platform <strong>&#40;pages 333&#45;337&#41;</strong> along with numerous works by Granville Sharpe, arguing for the abolition of slavery.</p>

				<h3>Absalom Jones</h3>
				
				<p>Absalom Jones was born into slavery but worked to pay for, first his wife&#39;s, then his own freedom.&sup1; He became America&#39;s first black priest and founded a black church after the Methodist congregation he was a part of tried to enforce segregation on its members.&sup2;</p>
				
				<p>During 1793 there was an outbreak of Yellow Fever in Philadelphia. A doctor named Rush, believing blacks to be naturally immune to the disease, encouraged the black community to help care for the sick and help bury the dead.&sup3; Following the outbreak, accusations were made that members of the black community had acted greedily in over charging the sick for their services. This accusation was refuted by Absalom Jones in a pamphlet he produced.</p>

				<h3>Olaudah Equiano</h3>
				
				<p>Olaudah Equiano&#39;s biography states his place of birth as Eboe in present day Nigeria.&sup1; He was kidnapped and sold into slavery at the age of 11. In 1757 he was bought by a navel captain for the sum of £40 and traveled extensively on the seas. He received some education in this time and worked to earn the money to buy his freedom.&sup2;</p>
				
				<p>While in London he became involved in the movement for the abolition of slavery and was a key member of the Sons of Africa. Knowing that his own story would be crucial to the abolition movement, he was aided in publishing his autobiography by British abolitionists Hannah Moore, Josiah Wedgwood and John Wesley.&sup3;</p>
				
				<p>The book was a success and helped to make Equiano very wealthy,&sup1; but was also crucial in raising the awareness of the plight of those in slavery. Some regard him as the originator of the slave narrative.&sup3;</p>

				<h3>Thomas Clarkson</h3>

His essay attracted him to the attention of the abolitionist Granville Sharp.&sup2;</p>
				
				<p>Thomas Clarkson traveled extensively gathering evidence about the slave trade and in 1788 published his Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade.&sup1; Another notable publication by Clarkson was <em>A summary view of the slave trade, and of the probable consequences of its abolition.</em> Both of these works are available on the Historical Text platform.</p>

				<h3>John Wesley</h3>
				
				<p>John Wesley, famous for his role in the Methodist church, visited America between 1736 and &#39;37 to preach. Whilst there he came into contact with enslaved people and was unhappy with the way that they were treated but did not immediately act to try to change things.&sup1;</p>
				
				<p>Like Thomas Clarkson, Wesley read Benezet&#44;s Some historical account of Guinea and following the success of the Somerset case, Wesley was inspired to write his tract <em>Thoughts upon Slavery in 1774.</em>&sup2;</p>
