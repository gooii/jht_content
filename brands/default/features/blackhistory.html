            <h1>Black History</h1>

            <p class="lead">We want to highlight content within Historical Texts that showcases the lives or works of notable black individuals, the fight for the abolition of slavery, and bring to you poetry and biographies written to raise awareness of the conditions of those in slavery. We hope that we have balanced bringing you content that highlights the injustice of slavery, with stories and works of notable black individuals who should be celebrated for their achievements and contributions to British society.</p>
			
			<p>We are aware that here at Historical Texts we are information professionals rather than historians. Our aim with this project is to highlight suitable and informative content from our collection. If you feel that we have missed sharing crucial content that you know to be present, particularly in EEBO or ECCO, please do send a message to our helpdesk &#40;<a href="mailto:Historicaltexts@jisc.ac.uk">Historicaltexts@jisc.ac.uk</a>&#41; so that we can improve for the future.</p>

			<h3>Francis Barber</h3>

					    

		  <p>Born &quot;Some time around 1735&quot;&sup1;</p>
							<p>Died 1801</p>
							<p>Francis Barber was born in Jamaica and brought across to England by his master, Colonel Richard Bathurst, who paid for his education in a school in Yorkshire. He was then sent to work as a valet for Dr Samuel Johnson in 1752 following the death of his wife.&sup2; In 1754 Barber’s owner died leaving him £12 and his freedom. He ran away to sea and Dr Johnson later arranged for his discharge from the Navy and further education for him.&sup2; Barber was one of two people present at the death of the famed writer and was given an annual sum of £71 in Johnson’s will.&sup3;</p>
							<p>Frances Barber is mentioned in James Boswell&#39;s book regarding the life of Samuel Johnson which can be found in the Historical Texts Platform. It should be noted that he is not the author of the book More Last Words of Dr Johnson with the misleading author name Francis, Barber,&sup3; although this book is also present in Historical Texts.</p>
