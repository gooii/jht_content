            <h1 id="skipTarget">Advisory Board</h1>

            <p>To ensure that the service develops in line with current and future needs of teachers, learners and researchers in the UK HE and FE community, an Advisory Board has been set up for Historical Texts.</p>
            <p>Members of the board work with Jisc Collections to identify and agree new content to be licensed for the platform. They also recommend enhancements to the platform functionality and interface, in order that they integrate with and support use in education and research. The board members are instrumental in discussing and devising future strategies to help us preserve and sustain the platform, and they have ownership of the Historical Texts budget.</p>
            <p>Members of the boards include teaching staff, researchers and librarians from higher and further education institutions. The advisory board is open to all and we welcome new members.</p>

            <p>Chaired by Gabriel Egan, Professor of Shakespeare Studies at De Montford University, the Historical Texts Advisory Board agreed its terms of reference at its second meeting in January 2012. Full of enthusiastic members, each with their own area of expertise, the board has decided to take a pioneering and collaborative approach in driving forward the future of Historical Texts. </p>
