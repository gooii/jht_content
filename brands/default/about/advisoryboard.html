            <h1>Advisory board</h1>

            <p>To ensure that the service develops in line with current and future needs of teachers, learners and researchers in the UK HE and FE community, an Advisory Board has been set up for Historical Texts.</p>
            <p>Members of the board work with Jisc Collections and Mimas to identify and agree new content to be licensed for the platform. They also recommend enhancements to the platform functionality and interface, in order that they integrate with and support use in education and research. The board members are instrumental in discussing and devising future strategies to help us preserve and sustain the platform, and they have ownership of the Historical Texts budget.</p>
            <p>Members of the boards include teaching staff, researchers and librarians from higher and further education institutions. The advisory board is open to all and we welcome new members.</p>

            <p>Chaired by Gabriel Egan, Professor of Shakespeare Studies at De Montford University, the Historical Texts Advisory Board agreed its terms of reference at its second meeting in January 2012. Full of enthusiastic members, each with their own area of expertise, the board has decided to take a pioneering and collaborative approach in driving forward the future of Historical Texts. </p>
            <p>This is reflected in their terms of reference (below) and in their meeting discussions.</p>

            <p>We want the advisory board to be as open as possible – it is after all leading the development of a service that is owned by the UK HE and FE community. We welcome new members – teaching staff, researchers, students, librarians, information specialists, digital literacy experts, VLE managers…</p>
            <p>Membership means that you will be added onto the advisory board Jiscmail list, are invited to attend virtual and face to face meetings and can participate in sub groups on innovative projects and developments. It offers you an opportunity to share ideas, concerns and suggest potential opportunities for the future of the service – the meetings are not about sitting back and listening – members are in the driving seat.</p>

            <p>You can take a look at the principles and objectives of the Advisory Board and the meeting notes if you want an idea of what is involved.</p>

            <p>If you would like to become a member of this Advisory Board, please email the <a href="mailto:help@jisc-collections.ac.uk">Jisc Collections helpdesk</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="meetings">Meetings</h2>

            <p>The Advisory Board convenes two times a year and some of the meetings are held virtually to keep costs down and to minimise impact on members’ time.</p>

            <p>We use PowerPoint presentations for each meeting rather than lots of papers – this makes it easy for members to follow and also for us to post them here for everyone to read. We put the notes of discussions held at the meeting in the notes field of the presentation.</p>
