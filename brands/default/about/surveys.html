            <p>Each year we run an online user satisfaction survey in Historical Texts to gather feedback from the community to inform future developments. Summary highlights as well as links to all of the full survey reports are available on this page.</p>

            <h2>User satisfaction survey 2014-15</h2>
            <p>The Historical Texts user satisfaction survey ran from 13 January to 31 March 2015. A pop-up prompt appeared after logging into the platform and 137 responses were received from the community. Some highlights can be found below as well as a link to the full report.</p>

            <p>The new Historical Texts platform was released on 23 June 2014, replacing the previous Jisc Historic Books platform. Historical Texts uses different search software to Jisc Historic Books and includes a new custom-designed interface. Where comparisons are made with previous surveys, respondents were referring to the Jisc Historic Books platform. </p>

            <p>We were pleased to find that 77&#37; of respondents selected the top three highest recommendation ratings of 8, 9 and 10, indicating that they would recommend Historical Texts to a colleague. 76&#37; of respondents advised their overall experience of the service over the last 12 months was good and 85&#37; agreed that their work would take longer if Historical Texts was not available.</p>

            <p>We asked respondents to rate various aspects of the website this year and found that 91&#37; rated the quality of the content as good, 76&#37; rated the readability of the text on the support pages as good and 75&#37; rated the visual design as good. There were slightly more mixed results for ease of use (62&#37; rated it as good but 19&#37; rated it as poor), site search (57&#37; rated it as good but 21&#37; rated it as poor) and navigation (49&#37; rated it as good but 22&#37; rated it as poor), which we&#39;ll look into further. </p>
            <p>We asked what people liked about the service and many respondents commented on the breadth of material available as well as the ability to view texts online without needing to travel to holding archives.</p>
            <p>We also asked how the service could be improved. A range of suggestions were made including displaying additional bibliographic fields, the ability to download the full text for the images, more content and improved search and display of periodicals and multi-volume books. </p>
            <p>In terms of the next steps, many of the points raised are either requests for features that are already in development or are included as part of the planned future developments for the service. This includes improved periodicals search and browse functionality, download of EEBO full text transcriptions, display of additional bibliographic information and addition of new collections. So the findings from this survey helps to confirm we&#39;re heading in the right direction to continue to meet the needs of the community.

            Here is what we've done now in response to the feedback from the community.

                <p>Access to periodicals by date or issue number. The Chadwick Healey interface worked well for this; HT doesn't work at all.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>It would be good to download the plain text of the texts - eg either the OCRed material or, where available, the TCP material, especially now EEBO-TCP phase 1 is openly accessible.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>1. Facilitate searching by ESTC number. This has improved considerably over the last year or two, but the leading zeroes in ESTC numbers are still a problem. 2. The display of search results could be improved by grouping together multi-volume sets under a single record, and by supplying additional information in the list result view to help distinguish between similar editions of the same work. 3. Make links to Historical Texts available in ESTC.</p>

            <h3>We did...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>New periodicals search options are available to enable searching by date</li>
                <li>New download options for EEBO full text transcriptions (html, text and epub) are available.</li>
                <li>ESTC numbers can now be searched for with or without a leading zero.</li>
                <li>Multi-volume works are now grouped together.</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>User satisfaction survey 2013-14</h2>
            <p>Mimas ran the annual Jisc Historic Books user satisfaction survey from 20 December 2013 to 28 February 2014. A pop up prompt appeared after logging into the platform and 84 responses were received from the community. </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>It provides access to books that I can't get in any other way. It's great to see the original print and illustrations rather than a transcript. The little green box with the search pages highlighted is an excellent idea. The ability to download page images is great.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Users can access hard to find books fairly easily e.g. rare edition of a William Blake title that our University cannot access within its own physical stock. From my own research into a local country house library, finding books on the shelves but being able to read online. This means physical damage is minimised on actual books but the printed information is still available for me to use and research further. From a local history view (I've published on a small circle of male and female seventeenth-century Cheshire readers) Jisc HB was vital for finding books read that no longer exist in a collection but only in lists of books borrowed.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>We were pleased to see that 82% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that their work would take longer if Jisc Historic Books was not available (compared to 65% in 2012-13 survey). Also, 78% of respondents advised they strongly agreed or agreed that they would recommend the service (compared to 61% in 2012-13 survey).</p>
            <p>However, while it&#39;s clear the collections themselves are considered very valuable, and the ability to easily view rare texts online and the fact it saves researchers a visit to the holding library is appreciated, some comments indicated that access to the content via the Jisc Historic Books interface did not meet their needs. Some people advised that although they would recommend the service it was because it was the only method of access to the material for them, not because they liked using it.</p>
            <p>We asked how people found using Jisc Historic Books and while 40% said it&#39;s very easy or easy, 36% advised they found it difficult or very difficult. This is similar to the findings from the 2012-13 survey and indicates work needs to be done to improve usability, however, how people find using it may also depend on what they&#39;re trying to do with it.</p>
            <p>When asked what support and training was required, 33 out of 110 responses were for improved help pages/user guides. There were 31 selections for &#39;none&#39; though and a further 13 for &#39;other&#39; with several comments stating respondents didn&#39;t want help using the system they wanted a more user-friendly interface instead. Short introductory videos received 15 requests.</p>
            <p>Responses to the question of how Jisc Historic Books could be improved confirmed key areas that we&#39;re already aware of such as the PDF download process, viewing images clearly, limited advanced search options and search results relevance.</p>
            <p>We&#39;re currently building a new platform using different search software which we hope will address many of the issues raised. It will include a specially designed user interface to make searching for and viewing texts a lot easier. Feedback from this survey has already fed into the development process for the new platform and helped to confirm we&#39;re on the right track with the features and functionality we&#39;re developing. The new platform will be released in summer 2014.</p>
