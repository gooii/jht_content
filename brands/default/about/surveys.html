<h1>Surveys</h1>
                <p>Each year we run an online user satisfaction survey in Historical Texts to gather feedback from the community to inform future developments. Summary highlights as well as links to all of the full survey reports are available on this page.</p>
                
<h2>2014-15</h2>
                <p>The Historical Texts user satisfaction survey ran from 13 January to 31 March 2015. A pop-up prompt appeared after logging into the platform and 137 responses were received from the community. Some highlights can be found below as well as a link to the full report.</p>
                
                <img src="../images/support/ht-2015-surveydashboard.png"  alt="Survey dashboard 2015 screenshot"/>
                
                <p>The new Historical Texts platform was released on 23 June 2014, replacing the previous Jisc Historic Books platform. Historical Texts uses different search software to Jisc Historic Books and includes a new custom-designed interface. Where comparisons are made with previous surveys, respondents were referring to the Jisc Historic Books platform. </p>

<p>We were pleased to find that 77&#37; of respondents selected the top three highest recommendation ratings of 8, 9 and 10, indicating that they would recommend Historical Texts to a colleague. 76&#37; of respondents advised their overall experience of the service over the last 12 months was good and 85&#37; agreed that their work would take longer if Historical Texts was not available.</p>

<p>We asked respondents to rate various aspects of the website this year and found that 91&#37; rated the quality of the content as good, 76&#37; rated the readability of the text on the support pages as good and 75&#37; rated the visual design as good. There were slightly more mixed results for ease of use (62&#37; rated it as good but 19&#37; rated it as poor), site search (57&#37; rated it as good but 21&#37; rated it as poor) and navigation (49&#37; rated it as good but 22&#37; rated it as poor), which we&#39;ll look into further. </p>
<p>We asked what people liked about the service and many respondents commented on the breadth of material available as well as the ability to view texts online without needing to travel to holding archives.</p>
<p>We also asked how the service could be improved. A range of suggestions were made including displaying additional bibliographic fields, the ability to download the full text for the images, more content and improved search and display of periodicals and multi-volume books. </p>
<p>In terms of the next steps, many of the points raised are either requests for features that are already in development or are included as part of the planned future developments for the service. This includes improved periodicals search and browse functionality, download of EEBO full text transcriptions, display of additional bibliographic information and addition of new collections. So the findings from this survey helps to confirm we&#39;re heading in the right direction to continue to meet the needs of the community.

<blockquote>
  <p>Access to periodicals by date or issue number.  The Chadwick Healey interface worked well for this; HT doesn't work at all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would be good to download the plain text of the texts - eg either the OCRed material or, where available, the TCP material, especially now EEBO-TCP phase 1 is openly accessible.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. Facilitate searching by ESTC number.  This has improved considerably over the last year or two, but the leading zeroes in ESTC numbers are still a problem. 2. The display of search results could be improved by grouping together multi-volume sets under a single record, and by supplying additional information in the list result view to help distinguish between similar editions of the same work. 3. Make links to Historical Texts available in ESTC.</p>
