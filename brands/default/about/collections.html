            <p>EEBO is comprised of titles listed in the English Short Title Catalogue &#40;ESTC&#41; I and II which are compiled from&#58;</p>
            <p>The options available are&#58;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pollard &amp; Redgrave's Short&#45;Title Catalogue &#40;1475&#45;1640&#41;</li>

                <li>Early English Books Tract Supplement</li>
            </ul>
            <p>EEBO covers a wide range of diverse subject areas including english literature, history, philosophy, linguistics, theology, law, music, fine arts, education, mathematics and science. Including influential works such as Newton's Principia Mathematica and various works by Shakepeare making it a key early modern research resource.</p>

            <h3>Text Creation Partnership</h3>

            <p>All works included in the Historical Texts EEBO collection have page images &#40;digital facsimiles&#41;. These pages have been digitised by opening &#40;which often means there are two physical pages per image&#41; from microfilms, which is why they are black and white, and provided by ProQuest. Currently, for around 25&#37; of this collection, there are also searchable plain text transcriptions. These are manually transcribed versions of the page images, produced by the Text Creation Partnership &#40;TCP&#41;. The text transcriptions for individual works can be identified in Historical Texts on the results page by having a &quot;full text&quot; label underneath them. </p>
            <p>The full text available for the page images in the EEBO collection have been created by the EEBO&#45;TCP. EEBO&#45;TCP is a partnership between ProQuest and over 150 libraries to create searchable, TEI&#45;compliant SGML&#47;XML texts to support the page images for titles in the EEBO collection. The texts are created by manual transcription, rather than OCR which has been used for the ECCO and BL collections, as OCR would not be able to easily decipher the images for these pre&#45;1700 works. </p>
            <p><strong>EEBO&#45;TCP Phase I</strong> began in 1999 as a collaboration between ProQuest, the University of Michigan and Oxford University and created searchable texts for 25,000 titles. This phase is complete and the works are available within Historical Texts.</p>
            <p><strong>EEBO&#45;TCP Phase II</strong> was announced in 2008 and aims to create searchable text for the remaining 44,000 unique monographs in the EEBO collection. Historical Texts will be adding these text updates as and when they are made available. <strong>&#42;&#42;UPDATE&#42;&#42;</strong> as of June 21, 2016, text for 20,000 more titles has been added, taking the amount of EEBO records with searchable text on Historical texts to around 40&#37;.</p>

As of June 21, 2016 these records have been added to Historical Texts and replace the existing Optical Character Recognition &#40;OCR&#41; full text for these records, providing improved searching for these publications.

			<p>The &ldquo;Visualising Medical History&rdquo; sister&#45;project has created powerful visualisation tools unique to the UKMHL collection, which researchers can use to search the content in new and hitherto untapped ways. The visualisations are available in a <a href="https://ukmhl.historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk/home">separate &ldquo;Labs&rdquo; area.</a></p>
