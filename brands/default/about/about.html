            <h1 id="skipTarget">About the Burney Newspaper Collection</h1>
			
			<p>The Burney Newspaper collection is the largest single collection of seventeenth and eighteenth century news media and newspapers held by the British Library. They were gathered together by the Reverend Charles Burney &#40;1757&#45;1817&#41;.</p>
			
			<h2>Content</h2>
			
			<p>The collection starts with parliamentary papers from 1603 and very early newspapers from the 1620s. The collection is made up of 700&#43; bound volumes of newspapers and newspaper pamphlets from London but also includes titles from further afield and abroad.</p>
			
			<p>In total the collection has over 1000 items including pamphlets, proclamations, newsbooks, periodicals and newspapers. There are nearly a million pages of content including some very rare items.</p>
			
			<h2>Digitisation and significance</h2>
			
			<p>The original collection is held by the British Library and is very delicate. A Jisc funded project to digitise the content opened up access to the collection to users who can no longer handle the fragile pages.</p>
			
			<p>The collection can be used to chart the rise of printed news as we know it today from early printed proclamations and reports from Parliament to newspapers as we would recognise them.</p>
			
			<h2>Titles</h2>
			
			<p>There are 1271 titles in the collections including the Daily Courant, the first daily newspaper published in London, and the London Gazette. Other titles include&#58;</p>
