            <h1>Development roadmap</h1>
            <p>Historical Texts is in continual development. You can see the list of features we&#39;ve scheduled or are currently working on below, along with the ones we&#39;ve already released. </p>
            <h2>In development</h2>
            <p>When work is scheduled we&#39;ll add it to the roadmap with the &#34;scheduled&#34; status. When we start work on a feature the status will change to &#34;in development&#34;. It will then change to &#34;in testing&#34; when it&#39;s nearly ready for release and it&#39;s being tested internally. It&#39;s difficult to specify timescales for development work as we don&#39;t know what issues we&#39;ll encounter and need to overcome along the way though.</p>
            <p><strong>Last updated&#58; 6 July 2018</strong></p>

            <h3>User evaluation of search and results pages and another look at the viewer</h3>
            <h4 class="follows">Mar - Apr 2014</h4>
            <p>During late March and early April the third round of user evaluation was conducted, looking at the search and results pages as well as another review of the book viewer.</p>
            <p>The same Webinar format as previously was followed, with two sessions each week for the first two weeks, then a single session on the final week for the book viewer. A shared Google document was available for people to add comments to after the sessions after they had had time to familiarise themselves with the interface. Members of the Advisory Board and User Group were invited to attend and given access to the interface for testing purposes.</p>
            <h4>Browsing</h4>
            <p>The browse feature has been designed and initially shows some of the Thomason Tracts, so we asked if the display and navigation, as shown in the screenshot below, was as people would expect. </p>
            <p>
                <!--<a href="../supportimages/jhb/HT-Browse-TT.gif" target="_blank"><img src="../supportimages/jhb/HT-Browse-TT.gif" alt="book viewer default view" width="700" class="fancy"/></a>--></p>
            <h4>Searching</h4>
            <p>On the search page, we created an ‘add another’ row function to enable people to build up complex searches, so we asked how intuitive that is to use. We also explained that building Boolean searches using this method is difficult as there is no way to group terms by brackets, so you can’t tell the difference between:</p>
            <p>(term1 AND term2) OR term3<br> term1 AND (term2 OR term3)</p>
            <p>Although you can enter Boolean search terms with brackets directly into the search box, the search software provides an alternative by using MUST, SHOULD and MUST NOT instead. It does this by treating each term as ‘compulsory’ (it MUST appear in the results) or ‘optional’ (it SHOULD appear in the results). Using this method, the results would show everything that matched the ‘MUST’ field, with those that matched the ‘SHOULD’ field as well ranked higher. So if you were looking for all texts by Shakespeare, and wanted to see those with Venus in the title listed at the top of the results you would enter:</p>
            <p>Author &gt; Shakespeare </p>
            <p>SHOULD contain &gt; Title &gt; Venus</p>
            <p>As shown in the screenshot below.</p>
            <p>
                <!--<a href="../supportimages/jhb/HT-Search-Should.png" target="_blank"><img src="../supportimages/jhb/HT-Search-Should.png" alt="book viewer default view" width="700" class="fancy"/></a>--></p>
            <p>Variant spellings (e.g. Shakespeare, Shakespear), printing substitutions (‘vv’ used instead of ‘w’) and other text variations (e.g. OCR errors such as f’ for the ‘long s’) were discussed, which would be the highest priority to support and whether printer substitutions need to be separated from general OCR errors.</p>
            <h4>Results display</h4>
            <p>We asked about the results list, whether the right information was displayed on it, whether it was intuitive to open a text using the thumbnail or title as well as opening a additional text in a new tab by right clicking the title on the results page. We also requested feedback on whether there was any other bibliographic information users would like the see under ‘more information’ for each result.</p>
            <p>We asked whether it was clear how to get back to the results list from the viewer by using the ‘Results’ link near the top left as well as whether the navigation bar at the top needed any options adding or removing and whether it should appear when in the viewer as well.</p>
            <p>The system currently provides live updates on the number of results as you type, so we asked if this was liked or whether people would want the update to only happen after you pressed the ‘search’ button. Questions were raised about what happens if you mistype and some people would expect to only see the number updated after they pressed ‘search’.</p>
            <p>We also asked about the number of results per page, and whether people would want infinite scrolling, so more results would load as you scrolled down the list, or whether they wanted pagination, which is currently set to 100, 500, 1000, 2000 results per page. The preference seemed to be for pagination and there were discussions over the length of time it would take for larger numbers of results to be displayed, and whether it might make sense to be able to switch the thumbnails next to each result off in these cases so the results load faster.</p>
            <h4>What's next?</h4>
            <p>As with the previous rounds of consultation, the sessions were found extremely useful by the development team in terms of understanding how people would expect the system to work and what they want to be able to do with it. The feedback from these sessions has been incorporated into the development and we are now preparing to release the BETA version of Historical Texts in early May. All institutions who currently subscribe to Jisc Historic Books will be able to access and test the BETA version.</p>


            <h3>User evaluation of book viewer</h3>
            <h4 class="follows">Jan - Feb 2014</h4>
            <p>During late January and February the second round of user evaluation was conducted, this time taking a first look at some real software, rather than just designs.</p>
            <p>The book viewer has been built first, as it’s using standard software and so could be created faster. It has three panels, the central one displaying the page image itself, then a panel to the left enabling you to navigate and search within the text using search terms and thumbnails, as well as navigating and searching your whole results set. A panel to the right will display the bibliographic information for the title you are looking at, the table of contents (where available), the text supporting the image (either the machine generated optical character recognition (OCR) for ECCO and BL, or manually keyed text for EEBO where available) and HTML where available.
            </p>
            <p>
                <!--<a href="../supportimages/jhb/book-viewer-3-panels.png" target="_blank"><img src="../supportimages/jhb/book-viewer-3-panels-small.png" alt="book viewer default view" width="700" class="fancy"/></a>--></p>
            <p>The panels can be re-sized as required by dragging them to your desired position, and your settings can be remembered for the next time you use the system.</p>
            <p>The central panel enables you to zoom in and out on the page image, expand or hide the panels to the left and right, switch to full screen mode, toggle whether highlighting is on or off and rotate the image.</p>
            <p>
                <!--<a href="../supportimages/jhb/book-viewer-default.png" target="_blank"><img src="../supportimages/jhb/book-viewer-default-small.png" alt="book viewer default view" width="700" class="fancy"/></a>--></p>
            <p>Like with the first round of user consultation, over a period of three weeks, webinar sessions were run using WebEx to demo the book viewer and it’s features and ask for feedback. Our Advisory Board and User group were invited to attend the sessions facilitated by <a href="http://www.sero.co.uk">Sero Consulting</a>, <a href="http://www.ostephens.com">Owen Stephens Consulting</a>, <a href="http://www.gooii.com">Gooii</a> and the project manager Scott Gibbens at <a href="http://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk">Jisc Collections</a>, and, again, two sessions were run each week. Following each weeks feedback, changes were made accordingly to the book viewer, and the changes shown at the next iteration the following week. </p>
            <p>Many interesting discussions were had during these sessions and some of the key topics covered included:</p>
            <h4>Terminology</h4>
            <p>This is something that has caused confusion in the current system, and we’re keen to try and make this as clear as possible in the new platform. There can be confusion between the terms 'image' number (number of the digitised image) and 'page' number (physical page in the printed text). There is also possible confusion with the term ‘image’ itself, which could mean 'page image' or 'illustration'. The terms ‘text’ (referring to the manually keyed EEBO text and the machine generated optical character recognition (OCR) for ECCO and the BL collections) and ‘html’ were also raised as not necessarily that clear, or the difference between them.</p>
            <h4>Zoom</h4>
            <p>The smooth zoom controls were liked, and the best way to indicate where you are on an image, once you have zoomed in, was discussed and a mini-page image was suggested.</p>
            <h4>Icons and Chevrons</h4>
            <p>Some people prefer icons, others prefer text to describe options in the viewer and where icons are used a tooltip was wanted when you hover over it, to make it clear what it does. Using chevrons to indicate the direction the left and right panels open in also caused some confusion, as some people thought they should point one way and others the opposite way.</p>
            <h4>Full screen</h4>
            <p>The option to remove all other information from the screen apart from the image viewed was offered and support was received for this feature.</p>
            <h4>Default layout</h4>
            <p>The new book viewer contains a lot of features, and not everyone will want to use all of them, or use them every time they view a text, so we asked what the default view should display when you first open a text. We offered an option with the page image in the central panel maximised, with the panels to the right and left minimised, so you can open them if and when you want to, and this was welcomed.</p>
            <h4>Navigation</h4>
            <p>Navigating by page number as well as image number was something people were really keen to have, with the appreciation that there can be inaccuracies in the pagination, and there aren’t always page numbers for all pages. As well as being able to locate all the illustrations in a text. </p>

            <h4>Double page images</h4>
            <p>The option to view two page images side by side was shown. For EEBO, which has been digitised by opening, this would mean being able to display four physical pages at a time. The feature was welcomed and discussions centered around whether you would want to navigate two images or one image at a time, which image you were on when zooming or displaying the supporting manually keyed or OCR text. </p>
            <h4>Thumbnails</h4>
            <p>The size of the thumbnails was discussed, and whether they should be available in different sizes, as well as whether it would be helpful to have image and/or page numbers on them.</p>
            <h4>What's next?</h4>
            <p> We're working on the search, browse, results display and homepage parts of the user interface now and the next round of user consultation in March will show real searches being run and results displayed. Further data analysis and data ingest is going on and images are being processed to provide the zoom feature.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, if you have any comments, questions or feedback on the book viewer please do let the team know by contacting our helpdesk at <a href="mailto:historicbooks@mimas.ac.uk">historicbooks@mimas.ac.uk</a>.</p>

            <h3>User evaluation of initial interface designs</h3>
            <h4>Nov - Dec 2013</h4>
            <p>During November and December 2013 feedback was sought from the Jisc Historic Books Advisory Board and User Group on the initial designs for the new user interface created by our development partners <a href="http://www.gooii.com">Gooii</a>. Essentially these are like screenshots of what each page in the interface could look like. At this stage it's easy to completely change the layout and options as no software has been programmed yet, but people can visualise how it will work and suggest alterations.</p>
            <p>Over a period of three weeks, webinar sessions were run using WebEx to introduce the designs and discuss the features that will be available initially and the Advisory Board and User Group were invited to attend as many sessions as they could. The webinars were facilitated by our development partners at <a href="http://www.sero.co.uk">Sero Consulting</a>, <a href="http://www.ostephens.com">Owen Stephens Consulting</a>, <a href="http://www.gooii.com">Gooii</a> and the project manager Scott Gibbens at <a href="http://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk">Jisc Collections</a>. Each week two sessions were held to run through the same designs, on different days and at different times, to provide more flexibility for people to join one. Each week a new iteration of the designs, called a 'wireframe', was produced based on feedback from the previous week. </p>
            <p>Members of the Advisory Board and User Group were also given the opportunity to feedback after the webinars through a Google User Evaluation document, which provided links to each individual wireframe and invited comments on them. Librarians at subscribing institutions were also given the opportunity to comment and pass details of the evaluation document on to interested academics and students at their institutions. </p>
            <p>The design team at Gooii created the screencast below<a href="http://youtu.be/Iz4QtwVVcM0"></a> to provide a walkthrough after the final session in week three (select the full screen button in the bottom right hand corner of the video to maximise the viewing window).</p>
            <p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Iz4QtwVVcM0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br /> Screencast created by <a href="http://www.gooii.com">Gooii</a></p>

            <p>The screencast runs for 13 minutes and you can jump straight to specific sections of it on the YouTube website using the links below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://youtu.be/Iz4QtwVVcM0/">Basic search</a></li>

            </ul>

            <p>These sessions were extremely useful for the development team to understand how the community want to use the system and feedback from the participants indicated they appreciated the opportunity to help shape the new platform.</p>
            <p> Behind the scenes, the teams at <a href="http://www.k-int.com">Knowledge Integration</a> and <a href="http://mimas.ac.uk">Mimas</a> and our metadata expert at <a href="http://www.ostephens.com">Owen Stephens Consulting</a>, are busy analysing the data, creating import and processing frameworks, data models and data importers for each collection.</p>
            <h4>What's next?</h4>
            <p> Work has started to build the user interface, and the next round of user evaluation in late January and early February 2014 will be looking at real software rather than wireframes. </p>
            <p>In the meantime, if you have any comments, questions or feedback on these designs please do let the team know by contacting our helpdesk at <a href="mailto:historicbooks@mimas.ac.uk">historicbooks@mimas.ac.uk</a>.</p>
