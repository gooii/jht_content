            <p>We are using <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org">Elasticsearch</a> open source software to index the data in Historical Texts.</p>
            <p>To run a search enter your search terms in the search box and select the &quot;search&quot; button. By default, this will search all of the information in the bibliographic records as well as the full text and you can enter bibliographic numbers &#40;ESTC number for ECCO, STC or Wing number for EEBO&#41; into the Search box when searching over All fields, not just the Bibliographic Number field. The search software is not case&#45;ensitive so &quot;Shakespeare&quot; will return the same results as &quot;shakespeare&quot;. The number of matching results will be shown to the right of the Search box. </p>
			<p><i>It is worth noting that you can see where in a publication your search terms match using the &quot;Pages&quot; tab in the &quot;Search&quot; panel, within the Viewer &#45; and that you can then search for new terms within the publication using the Search box at the top of the &quot;Pages&quot; tab. For more information, see the section on the <a href="/help#viewer">Viewer</a></i>. 
            <p>If you do want to limit your search to a particular field e.g. Title, Author or Bibliographic Number, you can do so using the drop&#45;down list to the left of the Search box.</p>

            <p>Subject is defined differently in the bibliographic information in different collections. For ECCO, there are eight broad subject areas. For EEBO, there are several hundred categories and there are various  subject classifications including subject location, subject person, subject genre&#47;form.

          <h2>Genre&#47;material type</h2>
            <p>Genre&#47;material type describes both the form of the item and the content in EEBO. We have merged Genre&#47;material type because in the metadata the physical form and content type are often mixed up and the number of terms are fairly small. The material type in some cases is also treated as a subject term. There are 6 broad types, 21 sub&#45;types &#40;which is a mixture of more specific material type and '&lsquo;content&rsquo; type&#41;, and over 300 form and genres.</p>

          <h2>Building up complex queries</h2>
            <p>To build up a complex query you can either type your query into the search box directly using boolean operators or use the add another row feature. Simply select  &quot;Advanced Search&quot; on the search page to show additional search features. From here you can add new rows and specify whether your terms MUST, SHOULD or MUST NOT appear in your results.</p>
            <p>The first clause of the search &#40;in the main search box&#41; is a MUST &#45; so the results must include whatever goes in that first box. This means that whatever else goes in the search you are essentially starting from a situation where the search in the first box is compulsory. This means that adding a SHOULD clause to this cannot increase the set of results. Adding a SHOULD clause cannot reduce the set of results either &#40;as the clause is optional&#41;.</p>

<p>This means that adding a SHOULD clause does not change the total number of results. What it does do is re&#45;order the results when using the relevance ranking, so those items matching the SHOULD clauses come to the top.</p>


            <hr />
	   
               
          <h2 id="operators">Operators, Regular Expressions and Reserved Characters </h2>
            <h2>Boolean operators</h2>
            <p>The familiar Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT &#40;alternatively you can write them as &amp;&amp;, &#124;&#124;, &#33;&#41; are supported and can be entered directly into the search box. NOT takes precedence over AND, which takes precendence over OR and you can combine these operators with brackets. These operators can affect the terms to the left and right of them.</p>
            <p>You can also use the prefered Elasticsearch operators &lsquo;&#43;&rsquo; &#40;which means the term MUST be present&#41; and &lsquo;&#45;&rsquo; &#40;which means the term MUST NOT be present&#41;.  These operators can only affect the terms to the right of them.</p>
            <p>The example below finds all results for &quot;shakespeare&quot; without &quot;venice&quot; in.</p>
            <pre>
                shakespeare &#45;venice</pre>

		  <p>By default, any terms you enter in the search box MUST be present. For instance, all of the searches below are identical&#58;</p>
            <pre>
           	shakespeare &#45;venice ode</pre>
			<pre>
            	&#43;shakespeare &#45;venice ode</pre>
			<pre>
            	&#43;shakespeare &#45;venice &#43;ode</pre>

          <h2>Wildcard operators</h2>
            <p>Two wildcard operators are available&#58;</p>
            <pre>
                &#42; &#61; Match any character, including no character
                &#63; &#61; Match any single character&#59; will not match no character</pre>
            <p>Please avoid wildcard characters occurring at or before the third position as they may produce too many unrelated matches.</p>

          <h2>Proximity operators</h2>
            <p>Proximity operators enable you to specify the distance &#40;in number of words&#41; your search terms are from each other in the text. You can specify the number using a tilda and a number after the term itself, to widen the proximity increase the number. </p>
            <p>The example below finds king and queen within 5 words or less of each other.</p>
            <pre>
                &quot;king queen&quot;&#126;5
            </pre>

          <h2>Regular expressions</h2>
            <p>Searching using regular expressions is supported and terms can be entered directly into the search box wrapped in forward slashes &quot;/&quot;. Historical Texts uses Elasticsearch software to index the data and the full list of <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-regexp-query.html#query-dsl-regexp-query">supported operators for regular expressions</a> can be found on the Elasticsearch website. </p>
            <p>The example below shows a regular expression to look for the word William.</p>
            <pre>
                &#47;W&#91;ilam&#93;&#123;0,6&#125;&#47;
            </pre>
            <div class="panel panel-default">
              <div class="panel-heading">
                <h3 class="panel-title">Regular expressions support</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="panel-body"> Support information and tutorials to help you construct regular expressions can be found in a range of places on the web, for example at the <a href="http://regexone.com/">Regex One</a> site and <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html">Regular Expressions Info</a>. </div>
            </div>

          <h2>Reserved characters</h2>
            <p>Certain characters function as operators in the system and if you want to use them in your search query, but not as an operator, then you will need to escape them with a leading backslash. </p>
            <p>The reserved characters are:</p>
            <pre>
                &#43; &#45; &amp;&amp; &#124;&#124; &#33; &#40; &#41; &#123; &#125; &#91; &#93; &#94; &quot; &#126; &#42; &#63; &#58; &#92; &#47;</pre>


                <h2>Fuzzy searching</h2>
                <p>Fuzzy searching enables you to search for terms that are similar to, but not exactly like our search terms.</p>
                <p>&quot;Fuzziness&quot; is measured in terms of the number of edits &#40;insertions and deletions&#41; between one term and another. You can specify the number of edits using a tilda and a number after the term itself.</p>
                <p>The example below finds &quot;king&quot;, and all other terms within a single edit of the word &quot;king&quot;:</p>
                <pre>king&#126;1</pre>
                <p>The maximum &quot;fuzziness&quot; supported is 2.<br />
                  &#40;obviously you can use the &quot;Fuzzy search&quot; checkbox for fuzzy searching but the operator is also supported in the main search box and allows you to apply the &quot;fuzziness&quot; to only certain terms within your search&#41;</p>
				<h2>Variant Forms and Misspelling searching</h2>
				<p>Users can also choose options for &quot;Variant Forms&quot;, &quot;Variant Spellings&quot;, &quot;Misspellings&quot; and &quot;Printer Replacements&quot; by clicking the &quot;Fuzzy and Variants&quot; drop&#45;down button and ticking the desired options. 
                <br />All the Variant words that are added to the search will appear below the Search bar, colour&#45;coded by Variant type. 
                You can remove Variant words from your search by clicking the &#39;x&#39; at the end of the icon.</p>
                <p>We recommend that users not use both the &#39;Fuzzy&#39; and &#39;Variants&#39; options at the same time, as this may yield unpredictable search results.</p>

                </span>
				<h2>Grouping</h2>
                <p> You can group together terms or search clauses together using parentheses. For example&#58;</p>
                <pre>shakespeare AND &#40;&#40;merchant AND venice&#41; OR &#40;king AND lear&#41;&#41;</pre>

                <h2>Field searching</h2>
                  <p>You can search specific fields by using the field name followed by a colon then the search term. For example</p>
                <pre>title&#95;all&#95;text&#58;shakespeare</pre>
                <p>You can use this in combination with other operators. For example&#58;</p>
                <pre>title&#95;all&#95;text&#58;&#40;shakespeare lear&#41;</pre>
                <pre>title&#95;all&#95;text&#58;lear AND author&#95;all&#95;text&#58;shakespeare&#126;2</pre>

                <p>You can also search for the presence&#47;absence of fields using &#39;&#95;missing&#95;&#39; and &#39;&#95;exists&#95;&#39;. For example to find all texts without edition information&#58;</p>
                <pre>&#95;missing&#95;&#58;publication.edition.statement</pre>
                <p>Bibliographic fields supported in the drop&#45;down Search box menu:</p>

         		 <ul>
          		 <li>All&#58; &#95;all</li>
                 <li>Title&#58; title&#95;all&#95;text</li>
                 <li> Author&#58; author&#95;all&#95;text</li>
                 <li>Publisher&#47;Printer&#58; lifecycle.publication.publisher.name.value_text</li>
                 <li>Place of publication&#58; lifecycle.publication.place.name.value&#95;text</li>
                 <li>Bibliographic number&#58; bibliographic&#95;number</li>
                 <li> Language&#58; language</li>
                 <li> Subject&#58; subject&#95;all&#95;text</li>
                 <li>Genre/Material type&#58; type&#95;or&#95;genre&#95;all&#95;text</li>
                 <li>Illustration Description&#58; searches both &#39;physical&#95;descriptors.other&#39; and &#39;figures&#39;</li>
                 </ul>
                <p>Also dates&#58;</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Earliest publication date for text&#58; lifecycle.publication.date.earliest</li>
                  <li> Latest publication date for text&#58; lifecycle.publication.date.latest</li>
                  </ul>


                <h2>Ranges &#40;numeric, date or text&#41;</h2>
                <p>You can search for numeric, date or text ranges. Inclusive ranges are specified with square brackets [min TO max] and exclusive ranges with curly brackets &#123;min TO max&#125;.</p>
                <pre>lifecycle.publication.publisher.name.value&#95;text&#58;&#91;aa TO ab&#93;</pre>
                <p>The example above would find all texts with a word in the publisher that comes between &quot;aa&quot; and &quot;ab&quot; in alphabetical order including occurrences of &#39;aa&#39; and &#39;ab&#39;. For example it would find the publication statement&#58;</p>
                <p>Aat the shop adioyning vnto Saint Mildreds Church in the Pultrye by John Allde </p>
                <p>Because of the word &quot;Aat&quot;</p>
                <pre>lifecycle.publication.date.earliest&#58;&#91;&#42; TO 1600&#125;</pre>
                <p>Finds all texts with an earliest publication date before 1600 &#40;up to 1599&#41;.</p>
                <p>More details on <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#_ranges_2" title="Range searching information on the Elasticsearch website">range searching</a> can be found on the Elasticsearch website. </p>

                <h2>Boosting</h2>
                <p>Boosting can be used to change the relevance ranking based on specific terms in your search &#45; it won&#39;t change the results retrieved, but will change the order. This is done by using the boost operator &#94;. For example&#58;</p>
                <pre>shakespeare lear&#94;2</pre>
                <p>Will boost the importance of &#39;lear&#39; in the results and so re&#45;order the search set to emphasise those where &#39;lear&#39; appears more often.</p>
                <p>The default boost value is 1, but can be any positive number. A boost value between 0 and 1 reduces relevance of a term.</p>

				<h2>Advanced search</h2>
				<p>More search options are available, but are hidden by default. To show the extra options, click the &quot;Advanced Search&quot; drop&#45;down button to the right of the page.</p>
				<p>The extra options are&#58;</p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>Type &#45; Search on all the texts, or on Periodicals only.</li>
				<li>Filter by date &#45; included undated, exclude undated, undated only, or specify a date or range</li>
				<li>Specify which collection or collections to search on</li>
				<li>Search on Description only, Full Text Only, or both</li>
				<li>Filter by Illustrated, Not Illustrated, or both</li>
				<li>Add rows to introduce additional search terms, using MUST, SHOULD or MUST NOT conditional logic, and searching on any fields available in the normal Search box</li>
				<li>Reset button to clear down the search interface</li>
                </ul>   
				
				<span class="image">
				<img src="../../images/support/screenshots/advancedsearch-700px.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing the additional options available when Advanced Search is expanded"/>
				</span>
				<h2>Text type &#45; Periodicals search</h2>
				<p>By default all text types will be searched automatically. To specify searching on Periodicals only, click the Periodicals button.
				<br />Selecting the Periodicals button allows for finer graduations of date range to be entered into the Date Range field, in the format DD&#47;MM&#47;YYYY&#45;DD&#47;MM&#47;YYYY, e.g. 16&#47;1&#47;1642&#45;16&#47;10&#47;1653.
				</p>
				<h2>Filter by date</h2>
				<p>By default, searches will return data from all available date ranges. Clicking the drop&#45;down arrow and selecting the radio button next to the date range field allows users to select from &quot;Including Undated&quot;, &quot;Excluding Undated&quot; or &quot;Undated Only&quot; options.</p>
				<p>&quot;Including Undated&quot; is the default for searching. It also allows for undated records to be included alongside dated records matching a specified range as entered into the date range field &#40;e.g. 1600&#45;1645 plus any undated records matching the other search terms&#41;.</p>
				<p>&quot;Excluding Undated&quot; will return only dated records matching a specified range as entered into the field &#40;e.g. 1600&#45;1645&#41;.</p>
				<p>&quot;Undated only&quot; will return only records with no date</P>
				<p><i>Please note that the &quot;Including Undated&quot;, &quot;Excluding Undated&quot; and &quot;Undated only&quot; Date Filter options are not available when the Periodicals button is selected.</i></p>
				<p>Individual years can be entered into the date range field, as can hyphenated ranges &#40;e.g. 1600&#45;1645&#41;.</p>
				<p><i>Selecting specific collections will have an effect on the returned results&#39; date range. Users can also use the Selector tool on the Histogram to further refine their search results by date range.</i></p>
				
				<h2>Specify which collection or collections to search on</h2>
				
				<p>By default, all collections in the Historical Texts service will be included in a search. To search on a single collection or any custom selection, expand the options for Advanced Search and untick the collections that are not required.</p>
				<p><i>Please note selecting specific collections will have a effect on the returned date range of your search results.</i></p>
				
				<h2>Search on Description only, Full Text Only, or both</h2>
				<p>By default, Historical Texts searches all full text and bibliographical data available. To restrict your search to only the bibliographic data (and not the full text) of the records, select the &quot;Description&quot; radio button. To search only the full text (and not the bibliographic data) select the "Full Text" radio button.</p>
				<p>Using the &quot;Full Text&quot; button will also ensure that <i>only</i> results with the full text included will be returned.</p>
				
				<h2>Filter by Illustrated, Not Illustrated, or both</h2>
				<p>To restrict your search to records specifically with or without illustrations, expand the Advanced Search options and click the &quot;Illustrated&quot; or &quot;Not Illustrated&quot; radio button as required.</p> 
				
				<h2>Add rows to introduce additional search terms</h2>
            <p>To build up a complex query you can either type your query into the search box directly using Boolean operators or use the "New Row" feature. Simply select  &quot;Advanced Search&quot; on the search page to show additional search features. From here you can add new rows by clicking the "New Row" button, and specify whether your terms MUST, SHOULD or MUST NOT appear in your results.  </p>
            <p>The first clause of the search (in the main search box) is a MUST - so the results must include whatever goes in that first box. This means that whatever else goes in the search you are essentially starting from a situation where the search in the first box is compulsory. This means that adding a SHOULD clause to this cannot increase the set of results. Adding a SHOULD clause cannot reduce the set of results either (as the clause is optional).</p>

<p>This means that adding a SHOULD clause does not change the total number of results. What it does do is re&#45;order the results when using the relevance ranking, so those items matching the SHOULD clauses come to the top.</p>

			<h2>Reset button to clear down the search interface</h2>	
			<p>Should you wish to reset the search interface back to the default values, you can click the red &quot;Reset&quot; button at the bottom of the &quot;Advanced Search&quot; options should you wish. Manually setting the values back to their defaults should work equally well.</p>

                        <h2 id="browse">Browsing</h2>
            <p>You can browse &#40;as opposed to search&#41; the entire contents of Historical Texts by Author, Date, Printer&#45;Publisher, Thomason Tracts and Thomason Tracts Broadsides by clicking the Browse Tab on the Navigation Bar near the top of the screen.</p>

              <br />
			  <br />
			  <p>You can also browse <strong>within</strong> the results of any search by Author, Printer&#47;Publisher, Date, Periodicals or Thomason Tracts by clicking the tabs along the top of the list of search results.

          <h2>Histogram</h2>
			<p>Once you&#39;ve run a search on Historical Texts, a Histogram displaying the date range distribution of your results graphically will be shown above your results list. Number of hits is shown on the Y&#45;axis and time in years is shown on the X&#45;axis.
			If you don&#39;t wish to see the Histogram, you can hide it by clicking the upwards&#45;acing arrow on the Date Range tab.</p>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="../../images/support/screenshots/histogram-700px.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing the Histogram, with the selector tool"/>
			</span>
			<p>You can click and drag within the Histogram to make a further date range selection within your existing results. When you release the mouse, the Search Results and Histogram display will be updated to reflect your new selection.</p>			
			
			<p>Please note, it is possible to make searches, or date range selections within a search that make the Histogram show a solid block of colour. While it might seem confusing, this is not incorrect - it&#39;s just a reflection of the how the results data has been filtered down.</p> 
			
          <h2>List view &#45; Grid view</h2>
            <p>Should you wish, you can toggle between a list view or a grid view of your search results by clicking the List or Grid icon buttons, shown next to the &quot;View Mode&quot; legend. When in Grid view, more results are visible on the screen at any one time, so less bibliographic data for each record is displayed by default. When in either view, click &quot;More Information&quot; to see the full bibliographic data for any given result, then &quot;Less Information&quot; to hide it again.</p>

            <h2 id="matchesintext">Viewing search term matches within a text</h2>
            <p>Beneath each search result on the results page is a &quot;matches within text&quot; link. Click on this to display pages where your search terms match within the publication. If &quot;Showing 0 matching image&#40;s&#41; out of 0&quot; is displayed instead then this may be due to the matches being in the bibliographic information, for example the title or author, instead of the full text. </p>

            <br />      
          
<p>You can click on a thumbnail or image number to go directly to that page of the text in the viewer. You can also select the thumbanil or title for the publication to open the whole publication in the viewer and select the left hand &quot;Search&quot; panel, then the &quot;Pages&quot; tab to view all of the search term matches as well.</p>
               
            <h2>EEBO Periodicals display</h2>
			<p>Publications that are part of a series are displayed differently, to enable you to quickly identify them and navigate the individual issue you require.
			If you search for a particular periodical e.g. &lsquo;Mercurius Politicus&rsquo;, you&#39;ll see that there is a bibliographic record for the periodical which has a &lsquo;Series&rsquo; thumbnail. Clicking this thumbnail transfers users to the &lsquo;Periodicals&rsquo; tab on the results page where the list of individual issues will be displayed. You can then select an issue to open in the viewer as usual.</p>
			<p>Individual issues of periodicals are displayed on the &lsquo;Periodicals&rsquo; tab in issue order.</p>

			<h2>Sorting and ordering results</h2>
            <p>You can order your search results by Relevance, Date &#40;Ascending&#41;, Date &#40;Descending&#41;, Author &#40;A&#45;Z&#41;, Title &#40;A&#45;Z&#41;. The default value is Relevance.</p>

            <h2>Filtering results</h2>
			<p>You can filter down the results of an existing search using the Printer&#47;Publisher, Author, Date, Subject, Text Type, Genre and Collection filters on the left hand side of the screen.</p>
               
            <h2>Number of results displayed</h2>
			<p>You can also change the number of results shown per page using the drop&#45;down arrow under the histogram, and navigate through your pages of results with the results navigation toolbar shown at the bottom of each page. You may want to hide the thumbnails on the results page if you are viewing 500 or above results per page as the page will take longer to load with the thumbnails. See the section below on how to do this.</p>

			<p>Results page thumbnails are displayed next to each search result on the results page by default. If you don't want to see them you can use the Thumbnails buttons above the filters on the left hand side of the results page to hide them. </p>
            <p>You may wish to do this if you are choosing to view large numbers of results per page e.g. 500 or above, as the page will take longer to load with the thumbnails.</p> 
            <p>Please note&#58; this setting only applies to viewing thumbnails on the results page, not the thumbnails in the left hand panel in the viewer for each text.</p>

          <h2 id="viewer">Viewer</h2>
                <p>To view the page images for a text simply select a record from your results list or the browse pages by clicking on the thumbnail or title hyperlink for it. This will open up the viewer, enabling you to view images, full text &#40;where available&#41; and thumbnails side by side. Using the navigation bar at the top of the screen, you can also download individual images &#40;JPEGs&#41; and whole publications &#40;PDFs&#41; and bibliographic citation information &#40;RIS&#41; and get a permanent URL for the publication when viewing an image.</p>
                <p>The viewer is comprised of three panels: a central panel displaying the images and a search panel to the left and a details panel to the right which are collapsed by default. To open the left hand panel select the &quot;Search&quot; button on the left hand side of the viewer and to open the right hand panel select the &quot;Details&quot; button on the right of the viewer as shown in the screenshot below.</p>

             <p>The options available on each of the three panels are listed below.</p>

          <h2 id="imagepanel">Image panel </h2>
          <p>The central panel in the viewer displays the page images. There is a toolbar on the left hand side of the panel providing the following options&#58;</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Zoom in </li>
                <li>Reset zoom &#40;reset the zoom level so the image is the original default size&#41;</li>
                <li>Zoom out</li>
                <li>Full screen &#40;opens the page image in full screen mode&#41; &#45; please note the Search and Details panels are not available when in full screen view, as this is intended to allow as much screen area to the images as possible.</li>
                <li>Highlight off &#40;feature not available yet but it will hide the search term highlighting&#41;</li>
                <li>Rotate &#40;rotate image by 90 degrees at a time&#41;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can use your mouse wheel or trackpad to zoom in and out instead of using the zoom in&#47;out buttons if you prefer and you can drag the image around using your mouse or trackpad.</p>
				<p>You can navigate through the publication using the navigation toolbar to the bottom of the screen. Here you can move forwards or backwards by page, jump to the start or end of a text, toggle between a single page or two pages reading view, or type a page number in the box and jump directly to that page. These will stay visible even if you switch to the full screen view using the left hand toolbar.</p>

			<h2 id="searchpanel">Search panel </h2>
            
          <p>To open the search panel, select the &quot;Search&quot; button on the left had side of the viewer. You can re&#45;size the panel by dragging the handle in the middle of the panel edge across to the right and you can close the panel using the cross at the top of the panel edge. There are three tabs providing options for navigating publications:</p>
          <h2 id="pagestab">Pages tab</h2>
          <p>Pages &#45; this lists images matching your search terms so you can select one to jump straight to that image. You can also enter new search terms into the box on the Pages tab to search <i>within the text itself</i>, then click any of the results below to jump to the relevant page in the Image Panel. You can order these results in either &quot;Pages Ascending&quot; or &quot;Page Descending&quot; using the drop&#45;down arrow as required as  well as select to search for variants and or illustrated pages using the drop down box beneath the search box.</p>

		  <h2 id="thumbstab">Thumbnails tab</h2>
          <p>This tab displays thumbnail images for every image in the publication. 30 are loaded at a time and as you scroll down additional thumbnails will continue to load until you reach the end of the publication. Simply click on a thumbnail image to jump directly to that image in the central viewer panel.</p>

<p>The publications tab displays all of the other publications in Historical Texts that match your search terms, so you can quickly jump to a different publication from within the viewer instead of returning to the results page to select another text.</p>

		<h2 id="detailspanel">Details panel</h2>

           <p>To open the details panel click on the &quot;details&quot; button on the right hand side of the viewer. You can re&#45;size the panel by dragging the handle in the middle of the panel edge across to the left and you can close the panel using the cross at the top of the panel edge. There are four buttons providing additional information on the publication: details, contents, text and tags.</p>
         <h2 id="detailstab">Details</h2>       
         <p>The details button displays the bibliographic information for a publication.</p>
         <img src="../images/support/screenshots/details-tab-700px.png" width="700" height="450" alt="Screenshot of the Details tab within the Details Panel in the Viewer"/>
		 <h2>Contents</h2>
         <p>The table of contents feature is currently in development, so this button is disabled, but it will be available soon.</p>
         <h2 id="texttab">Text</h2>
		 <p>The text button displays the full text supporting the images, where available.You can also navigate through the publication using the navigation toolbar to the top of this tab. Here you can move forwards or backwards by page, jump to the start or end of a text, toggle between a single page or two pages reading view. This might be preferable for users who primarily want to read from the full text rather than the images.</p>
         <p>Please note that full text is not available for all publications in Historical Texts. Publications with full text present will display a &quot;T&quot; icon in a grey square under &quot;details&quot; button when the panel is minimised. There is full text available for every title in ECCO and the BL 19th Century collections and this has been machine generated using Optical Character Recognition &#40;OCR&#41; software. There is full text for around a third of the EEBO collection currently and this has been manually keyed by the Text Creation Partnership. For the rest of the EEBO collection there are images and bibliographic information only. When full text is not available the full text tab will display the message &quot;Full text not available&quot;.</p>
         <img src="../images/support/screenshots/text-tag-700px.png" width="700" height="450" alt="Screenshot of the Text tab within the Details Panel in the Viewer"/>
		<h2 id="tagstab">Tags</h2>
        <p>The tags button enables you to create and view tags for indivdiual pages within the publication you are viewing. To create a tag open the page you want tag in the viewer and enter a name for the tag in the box at the top of the tags screen and click on the &quot;add tag&quot; button. The tag will be displayed below, along with any other tags you have created in the publication. Click on the page number for any tag to jump directly to that page.</p>
        <p> To view all of your tags for all publications select the &quot;My Texts&quot; then &quot;My Tags&quot; option from the black navigation bar at the top of the screen.</p>
        <p>Please note&#58; The My Tags feature requires logging in with an institutional account via the UK Federation &#40;Shibboleth and OpenAthens&#41; and is not available if you have accessed Historical Texts via IP authentication.</p>

                <p>Please note&#58; the Download button is only enabled on the Navigation bar when you have opened a publication in the viewer.

     <h1 id="cite">Citing Historical Texts</h1>
	<p>When citing publications in Historical Texts we suggest you include the publication details for the print source as well as the details for the online version. You can download citation information in RIS format for import into third-party bibliographic referencing tools.</p>

 <p>To view the bibliographic information for a publication select the &quot;details&quot; button in the right hand &quot;details&quot; panel in the viewer:</p>
    <img src="../images/support/screenshots/details-tab-700px.png" width="700" height="450" alt="details tab"/>
<p>To view the stable URL for a publication open the publication in the viewer and select the &quot;Share&quot; button:</p>
<img src="../images/support/screenshots/navigationbar-share-700px.jpg" width="700" height="50" alt=""/>
<p>To download a citation for any publication in Historical Texts in RIS format open the publication in the viewer and select the &quot;download&quot; option from the toolbar then &quot;download citation as RIS&quot;:</p>
<img src="../images/support/screenshots/download-700px-ann.jpeg" width="700" height="423" alt=""/>
  
<p>A suggested format for citing Historical Texts is listed below, however, it's advisable to check what format your tutor or department prefers for reports and research papers. The full text for the EEBO collection, where available, has been manually keyed by the <a href="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/tcp-eebo/" title="Text Creation Partnership (TCP) website">Text Creation Partnership (TCP)</a> and we would recommend the partnership are included in the citation for these texts. The full text for ECCO and the BL collections has been created mechanically by optical character recognition (OCR) software, so do not require any additional citation information.</p>

<p>Suggested format:</p>

<p>Author. Title. Place of publication, year of publication. Online resource. Online resource publisher. Date of access. Direct URL to the text.</p>  
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p>Citing a specific text:

<p>Newton, Isaac Sir. Philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica. Londini, 1687. Historical Texts. Jisc. Web. Date Month Year. <https://historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk/eebo-ocm12903105e></p>

<p>Citing a specific text from EEBO with a full text transcription from the Text Creation Partnership (TCP):</p>

<p>Newton, Isaac Sir. Philosophiæ naturalis principia mathematica. Londini, 1687. Text Creation Partnership digital edition. Historical Texts. Jisc. Web. Date Month Year. <https://historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk/eebo-ocm12903105e></p>

<p>Citing the resource as a whole (e.g. if you are referencing searches rather than specific texts):</p>

<p>Historical Texts. Jisc. Web. Date Month Year. http://historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk </p>

<p>You may wish to include the date of access in your citation because the data in Historical Texts is updated from time to time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional EEBO full text transcriptions, and corrections to existing transcriptions, from the <a href="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/tcp-eebo/" title="Text Creation Partnership (TCP) website">Text Creation Partnership (TCP)</a> are added as and when they are made available by the TCP</li>
<li>Additional EEBO publications are added as and when they are digitised and the images made available by ProQuest</li>
<li>New collections will be added in future</li>
</ul>

<p>These data changes may affect the number of results returned for your searches as well as whether full text is available for specific EEBO records. The dates of any data updates, along with the release of other new features, are listed on our <a href="../about/roadmap.html" title="Development roadmap">development roadmap</a>.</p>
