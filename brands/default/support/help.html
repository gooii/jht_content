		  <h1 id="navbar">Navigation bar</h1>
            <p>There is a black horizontal navigation bar at the top of the screen on every page of Historical Texts so you can quickly navigate to any part of the website from any page you are on. Some options are only be available on certain pages though, for example the download and share buttons  are only enabled when you have opened a publication. Other options such as &quot;My Texts&quot;, &quot;Print&quot; and &quot;Settings&quot;  are still in development and will be coming soon, so these features are currently unavailable.</p>



       	  <h1 id="search">Searching</h1>
            <h2>Standard search</h2>

            <p>We are using <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org">Elasticsearch</a> open source software to index the data in Historical Texts.</p>
            <p>To run a standard search enter your search terms in the search box and select the &quot;search&quot; button. By default, this will search all of the information in the bibliographic records as well as the full text and you can enter bibliograhic numbers (ESTC number for ECCO, STC or Wing number for EEBO) into the search box when searching over all fields not just the bibliographic number field. The search software is not case sensitive so &quot;Shakespeare&quot; will return the same results as &quot;shakespeare&quot;. The number of matching results will be shown to the right of the search box. </p>
            <p>If you do want to limit your search to a particular field e.g. title, author or bibliographic number you can do so using the drop down list to the left of the search box.</p>
            <p>The options available are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>All</li>
              <li>Title</li>
              <li>Author</li>
              <li>Printer/Publisher</li>
              <li>Place of publication</li>
              <li>Bibliographic number</li>
              <li>Language</li>
              <li>Illustration description</li>
              <li>Subject</li>
              <li>Genre</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Author</h2>
            <p>You can enter the author name in either first name, last name or last name, first name format and it will find the same results. </p>
            <pre>
                Thomas, Moore
                Moore, Thomas
            </pre>

          <h2>Bibliographic number (STC, Wing and ESTC numbers)</h2>
            <p>Records in EEBO and ECCO have bibliographic numbers and you can use these to search for specific records in the system. For EEBO there are STC, Wing and Thomason Tract numbers. For ECCO, there are ESTC numbers. The British Library 19th century collection does not have a bibliographic reference number.          </p>
          <p>You can enter bibliographic numbers directly into the default &quot;all&quot; fields search as well as in the specific bibliographic number search. </p>
          <p>Please note that you will need to be quite exact when using the bibliographic reference number search, for instance whether you enter a full stop or not along with the identifier will affect the results returned. This issue can be worked around by either using the 'All' fields search and just putting the bibliographic number in there (but sometimes this can result in lots of hits), or by using a wildcard character (*) at the end of the number. </p>

    </table>


            <h2>Subject</h2>
            <p>Subject is defined differently in the bibliographic information in different collections. For ECCO, there are eight broad subject areas. For EEBO, there are several hundred categories and there are various  subject classifications including subject location, subject person, subject genre/form. A search on the &quot;subject&quot; field will search over all of these fields in the bibliographic information.</p>

          <h2>Genre/material type</h2>
            <p>Genre/material type describes both the form of the item and the content in EEBO. We have merged Genre/material type because in the metadata the physical form and content type are often mixed up and the number of terms are fairly small. The material type in some cases is also treated as a subject term. There are 6 broad types, 21 sub-types (which is a mixture of more specific material type and 'content' type), and over 300 form and genres.</p>

             <table class="table table-bordered">

          <h2>Building up complex queries</h2>
            <p>To build up a complex query you can either type your query into the search box directly using boolean operators or use the add another row feature. Simply select  &quot;Advanced Search&quot; on the search page to show additional search features. From here you can add new rows and specify whether your terms MUST, SHOULD or MUST NOT appear in your results.  </p>
            <p>The first clause of the search (in the main search box) is a MUST - so the results must include whatever goes in that first box. This means that whatever else goes in the search you are essentially starting from a situation where the search in the first box is compulsory. This means that adding a SHOULD clause to this cannot increase the set of results. Adding a SHOULD clause cannot reduce the set of results either (as the clause is optional).</p>

<p>This means that adding a SHOULD clause does not change the total number of results. What it does do is re-order the results when using the relevance ranking, so those items matching the SHOULD clauses come to the top.</p>

            <h1 id="browse">Browsing</h1>
            <p>You can browse the contents of Historical Texts by author, printer/publisher, date, volume, Thomason Tracts and Thomason Tracts broadsides.</p>
            <p>

            <hr />

          <h1 id="operators">Operators, regular expressions and reserved characters </h1>
            <h2>Boolean operators</h2>
            <p>The familiar boolean operators AND, OR, NOT (alternatively you can write them as &amp;&amp;, ||, !) are supported and can be entered directly into the search box. NOT takes precedence over AND, which takes precendence over OR and you can combine these operators with brackets. These operators can affect the terms to the left and right of them.</p>
            <p>You can also use the prefered Elasticsearch operators '+' (which means the term MUST be present) and '-' (which means the term MUST NOT be present).  These operators can only affect the terms to the right of them.</p>
            <p>The example below finds all results for &quot;shakespeare&quot; without &quot;venice&quot; in.</p>
            <pre>
                shakespeare -venice</pre>

		  <p>By default, any terms you enter in the search box MUST be present. For instance, all of the searches below are identical:</p>
            <pre>
           	shakespeare -venice ode</pre>
			<pre>
            	+shakespeare -venice ode</pre>
			<pre>
            	+shakespeare -venice +ode</pre>

          <h2>Wildcard operators</h2>
            <p>Two wildcard operators are available:</p>
            <pre>
                * = Match any character, including no character
                ? = Match any single character; will not match no character</pre>
            <p>Please avoid wildcard characters occurring at or before the third position as they may produce too many unrelated matches.</p>

          <h2>Proximity operators</h2>
            <p>Proximity operators enable you to specify the distance (in number of words) your search terms are from each other in the text. You can specify the number using a tilda and a number after the term itself, to widen the proximity increase the number. </p>
            <p>The example below finds king and queen within 5 words or less of each other.</p>
            <pre>
                &quot;king queen&quot;~5
            </pre>

          <h2>Regular expressions</h2>
            <p>Searching using regular expressions is supported and terms can be entered directly into the search box wrapped in forward slashes &quot;/&quot;. Historical Texts uses Elasticsearch software to index the data and the full list of <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-regexp-query.html#query-dsl-regexp-query">supported operators for regular expressions</a> can be found on the Elasticsearch website. </p>
            <p>The example below shows a regular expression to look for the word William.</p>
            <pre>
                /W[ilam]{0,6}/
            </pre>
            <div class="panel panel-default">
              <div class="panel-heading">
                <h3 class="panel-title">Regular expressions support</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="panel-body"> Support information and tutorials to help you construct regular expressions can be found in a range of places on the web, for example at the <a href="http://regexone.com/">Regex One</a> site and <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html">Regular Expressions Info</a>. </div>
            </div>

          <h2>Reserved characters</h2>
            <p>Certain characters function as operators in the system and if you want to use them in your search query, but not as an operator, then you will need to escape them with a leading backslash. </p>
            <p>The reserved characters are:</p>
            <pre>
                + - &amp;&amp; || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ &quot; ~ * ? : \ /</pre>


                <h2>Fuzzy searching</h2>
                <p>Fuzzy searching enables you to search for terms that are similar to, but not exactly like our search terms.</p>
                <p>&quot;Fuzziness&quot; is measured in terms of the number of edits (insertions and deletions) between one term and another. You can specify the number of edits using a tilda and a number after the term itself.</p>
                <p>The example below finds 'king', and all other terms within a single edit of the word 'king':</p>
                <pre>king~1</pre>
                <p>The maximum 'fuzziness' supported is 2.<br />
                  (obviously you can use the 'Fuzzy search' checkbox for fuzzy searching but the operator is also supported in the main search box and allows you to apply the 'fuzziness' to only certain terms within your search)</p>
				<h2>Variant Forms and Misspelling searching</h2>
				<p>Users can also choose options for &quot;Variant Forms&quot;, &quot;Variant Spellings&quot;, &quot;Misspellings&quot; and &quot;Printer Replacements&quot; by clicking the &quot;Fuzzy and Variants&quot; drop&#45;down button and ticking the desired options. 
All the Variant words that are added to the search will appear below the Search bar, colour&#45;coded by Variant type. 
You can remove Variant words from your search by clicking the &#39;x&#39; at the end of the icon.</p>
<p>We recommend that users not use both the &#39;Fuzzy&#39; and &#39;Variants&#39; options at the same time, as this may yield unpredictable search results.</p>
                <img src="../../images/support/screenshots/fuzzyvariants-700px-ann.jpg" alt="Fuzzy and Variant Forms"/>
                <h2>Grouping</h2>
                <p> You can group together terms or search clauses together using parentheses. For example:</p>
                <pre>shakespeare AND ((merchant AND venice) OR (king AND lear))</pre>

                <h2>Field searching</h2>
                  <p>You can search specific fields by using the field name followed by a colon then the search term. For example</p>
                <pre>title_all_text:shakespeare</pre>
                <p>You can use this in combination with other operators. For example:</p>
                <pre>title_all_text:(shakespeare lear)</pre>
                <pre>title_all_text:lear AND author_all_text:shakespeare~2</pre>

                <p>You can also search for the presence/absence of fields using '_missing_' and '_exists_'. For example to find all texts without edition information:</p>
                <pre>_missing_:publication.edition.statement</pre>
                <p>Bibliographic fields supported in the drop down search box menu:</p>

         		 <ul>
          		 <li>All: _all</li>
                 <li>Title: title_all_text</li>
                 <li> Author: author_all_text</li>
                 <li>Publisher/Printer: lifecycle.publication.publisher.name.value_text</li>
                 <li>Place of publication: lifecycle.publication.place.name.value_text</li>
                 <li>Bibliographic number: bibliographic_number</li>
                 <li> Language: language</li>
                 <li> Subject: subject_all_text</li>
                 <li>Genre/Material type: type_or_genre_all_text</li>
                 <li>Illustration Description: searches both 'physical_descriptors.other' and 'figures'</li>
                 </ul>
                <p>Also dates:</p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Earliest publication date for text: lifecycle.publication.date.earliest</li>
                  <li> Latest publication date for text: lifecycle.publication.date.latest</li>
                  </ul>


                <h2>Ranges (numeric, date or text)</h2>
                <p>You can search for numeric, date or text ranges. Inclusive ranges are specified with square brackets [min TO max] and exclusive ranges with curly brackets {min TO max}.</p>
                <pre>lifecycle.publication.publisher.name.value_text:[aa TO ab]</pre>
                <p>The example above would find all texts with a word in the publisher that comes between 'aa' and 'ab' in alphabetical order including occurrences of 'aa' and 'ab'. For example it would find the publication statement:</p>
                <p>Aat the shop adioyning vnto Saint Mildreds Church in the Pultrye by John Allde </p>
                <p>Because of the word 'Aat'</p>
                <pre>lifecycle.publication.date.earliest:[* TO 1600}</pre>
                <p>Finds all texts with an earliest publication date before 1600 (up to 1599).</p>
                <p>More details on <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#_ranges_2" title="Range searching information on the Elasticsearch website">range searching</a> can be found on the Elasticsearch website. </p>

                <h2>Boosting</h2>
                <p>Boosting can be used to change the relevance ranking based on specific terms in your search - it won't change the results retrieved, but will change the order. This is done by using the boost operator ^. For example:</p>
                <pre>shakespeare lear^2</pre>
                <p>Will boost the importance of 'lear' in the results and so re-order the search set to emphasise those where 'lear' appears more often.</p>
                <p>The default boost value is 1, but can be any positive number. A boost value between 0 and 1 reduces relevance of a term.</p>

				<h2>Advanced search</h2>
				<p>More search options are available, but are hidden by default. To show the extra options, click the "Advanced Search" drop-down button to the right of the page.</p>
				<p>The extra options are&#58;</p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>Filter by date - included undated, exclude undated, undated only, or specify a date or range</li>
				<li>Specify which collection or collections to search on</li>
				<li>Search on Description only, Full Text Only, or both</li>
				<li>Filter by Illustrated, Not Illustrated, or both</li>
				<li>Add rows to introduce additional search terms, using MUST, SHOULD or MUST NOT conditional logic, and searching on any fields available in the normal Search box</li>
				<li>Reset button to clear down the search interface</li>
                </ul>   
				
				<img src="../../images/support/screenshots/advancedsearch-700px.jpg" alt="Advanced Search"/>
				
				<h2>Filter by date</h2>
				<p>By default, searches will return data from all available date ranges. Clicking the drop-down arrow and selecting the radio button next to the date range field allows users to select from "Including Undated", "Excluding Undated" or "Undated Only" options.</p>
				<p>"Including Undated" is the default for searching. It also allows for undated records to be included alongside dated records matching a specified range as entered into the date range field (e.g. 1600-1645 plus any undated records matching the other search terms).</p>
				<p>"Excluding Undated" will return only dated records matching a specified range as entered into the field (e.g. 1600-1645).</p>
				<p>"Undated only" will return only records with no date</P>
				<p>Individual years can be entered into the date range field, as can hyphenated ranges (e.g. 1600-1645).</p>
				<p><i>Selecting specific collections will have an effect on the returned results' date range. Users can also use the Selector tool on the Histogram to further refine their search results by date range.</i></p>
				
				<h2>Specify which collection or collections to search on</h2>
				
				<p>By default, all collections in the Historical Texts service will be included in a search. To search on a single collection or any custom selection, expand the options for Advanced Search and untick the collections that are not required</p>
				<p><i>Please note selecting specific collections will have a effect on the returned date range of your search results.</i></p>
				
				<h2>Search on Description only, Full Text Only, or both</h2>
				<p>By default, Historical Texts searches all full text and bibliographical data available. To restrict your search to only the bibliographic data (and not the full text) of the records, select the "Description" radio button. To search only the full text (and not the bibliographic data) select the "Full Text" radio button.</p>
				<p>Using the "Full Text" button will also ensure that <i>only</i> results with the full text included will be returned.</p>
				
				<h2>Filter by Illustrated, Not Illustrated, or both</h2>
				<p>To restrict your search to records specifically with or without illustrations, expand the Advanced Search options and click the "Illustrated" or "Not Illustrated" radio button as required.</p> 
				
				<h2>Add rows to introduce additional search terms</h2>
            <p>To build up a complex query you can either type your query into the search box directly using Boolean operators or use the "New Row" feature. Simply select  &quot;Advanced Search&quot; on the search page to show additional search features. From here you can add new rows by clicking the "New Row" button, and specify whether your terms MUST, SHOULD or MUST NOT appear in your results.  </p>
            <p>The first clause of the search (in the main search box) is a MUST - so the results must include whatever goes in that first box. This means that whatever else goes in the search you are essentially starting from a situation where the search in the first box is compulsory. This means that adding a SHOULD clause to this cannot increase the set of results. Adding a SHOULD clause cannot reduce the set of results either (as the clause is optional).</p>

<p>This means that adding a SHOULD clause does not change the total number of results. What it does do is re-order the results when using the relevance ranking, so those items matching the SHOULD clauses come to the top.</p>

			<h2>Reset button to clear down the search interface</h2>	
			<p>Should you wish to reset the search interface back to the default values, you can click the red "Reset" button at the bottom of the "Advanced Search" options should you wish. Manually setting the values back to their defaults should work equally well.</p>

          <h1 id="viewer">Viewer</h1>
                <p>To view the page images for a text simply select a record from your results list or the browse pages by clicking on the thumbnail or title hyperlink for it. This will open up the viewer, enabling you to view images, full text (where available) and thumbnails side by side. Using the navigation bar at the top of the screen, you can also download individual images (JPEGs) and whole publications (PDFs) and bibliographic citation information (RIS) and get a permanent URL for the publication when viewing an image.</p>
                <p>The viewer is comprised of three panels: a central panel displaying the images and a search panel to the left and a details panel to the right which are collapsed by default. To open the left hand panel select the &quot;Search&quot; button on the left hand side of the viewer and to open the right hand panel select the &quot;Details&quot; button on the right of the viewer as shown in the screenshot below.</p>

              <p>

			   </span>
              </p>

              <p>You can have all three panels open at the same time, or just one or two of them and you can re-size the panels by dragging the handle in the middle of the panel edge (highlighted by red boxes with arrows in the screenshot below) to the left or right. To close either panel click on the cross at the top of the panel edges, highlighted by the small red boxes in the screenshot below.</p>

         	 <p>

			   </span>
              </p>

             <p>The options available on each of the three panels are listed below.</p>

          <h2>Image panel</h2>
          <p>The central panel in the viewer displays the page images. There is a toolbar on the left hand side of the panel providing the following options: </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Zoom in </li>
                <li>Reset zoom (reset the zoom level so the image is the original default size)</li>
                <li>Zoom out</li>
                <li>Full screen (opens the page image in full screen mode)</li>
                <li>Highlight off (feature not available yet but it will hide the search term highlighting)</li>
                <li>Rotate (rotate image by 90 degrees at a time)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can use your mouse wheel or trackpad to zoom in and out instead of using the zoom in/out buttons if you prefer and you can drag the image around using your mouse or trackpad.</p>

          <h2>Search Panel</h2>
                <p>To open the search panel, select the &quot;Search&quot; button on the left had side of the viewer. You can re-size the panel by dragging the handle in the middle of the panel edge across to the right and you can close the panel using the cross at the top of the panel edge. There are three tabs providing options for navigating publications:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Results (this lists images matching your search terms so you can select one to jump straight to that image</li>
                  <li>Thumbnails (this displays thumbnail images for every image in the publication. 30 are loaded at a time and as you scroll down additional thumbnails will continue to load until you reach the end of the publication. </li>
                  <li>Publications (this displays all of the other publications in the platform that match your search terms, so you can quickly jump to a different publication from within the viewer instead of returning to the results page to select another text).</li>
                </ul>
          <h2>Details panel</h2>

                <p>To open the details panel click on the &quot;details&quot; button on the right hand side of the viewer. You can re-size the panel by dragging the handle in the middle of the panel edge across to the left and you can close the panel using the cross at the top of the panel edge. There are two tabs providing additional information on the publication:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Details (this displays the bibliographic information for a publication)</li>
                  <li>Full text (this displays the full text supporting the images, where available).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Please note that full text is not available for all publications in Historical Texts. There is full text available for every title in ECCO and the BL 19th Century collections and this has been machine generated using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. There is full text for around a third of the EEBO collection currently and this has been manually keyed by the Text Creation Partnership. For the rest of the EEBO collection there are images and bibliographic information only. When full text is not available the full text tab will display the message &quot;Full text not available&quot;.          </p>

          <h1 id="download">Downloading </h1>
                <p>When you have opened a publication in the viewer, choose the &quot;download&quot; button and select from  a range of download options available:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>individual image currently open in the viewer as a jpeg file</li>
                  <li>whole publication as a PDF file</li>
                  <li>citation information in RIS format to import into reference management software</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of these options provide an instant download of either a jpeg, PDF or RIS format file. These files will either open or download in your browser, depending on the browser you use and your local configuration settings for it. </p>
                <p>Please note: the download button is only enabled on the navigation bar when you have opened a publication in the viewer. On all other pages it is currently disabled and greyed out with a message stating &quot;feature not available&quot; as you can only download a publication when you have selected and opened it.              </p>

              </p>

<h1 id="stable">Stable URLs </h1>
          <p>The &quot;Share&quot; button on the navigation bar at the top of the screen provides a stable (permanent) URL for the publication you are viewing for you to copy and paste into your documents or web pages. The button is deactivated and greyed out until you open a publication in the viewer, at which point it is enabled and when you select it a dialogue box containing a stable URL for the publication will be displayed. </p>

       		   <p>&nbsp;</p>

			   </span>
              </p>

       		   <p>When you select the button the dialogue box below will open, displaying a stable URL for the publication for you to copy and paste into a web page or document:              </p>
