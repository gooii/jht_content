          <h1>Help file</h1>
		  
          <p>This is the Help page for the Burney Newspaper Collection. It is intended to assist researchers using the collection via this Historical Texts labs site.</p>
		  
		  <h2 id="navbar">Navigation bar</h2>
            <p>There is a black horizontal navigation bar at the top&#45;right of the screen on every page of Historical Texts so you can quickly navigate to any part of the website from any page you are on. Some options are only be available on certain pages though, for example the Download button is only enabled when you have opened a publication in the viewer.</p>
			<p>
				<img src="../images/support/screenshots/navigationbar-preview.jpg" alt=""/>
			</p>
			
			<h2 id="collections">Features of the Burney Collection</h2>
			
			<p>FULL TEXT &#45; Full text is available for every title in the collection. The text is machine generated using Optical Character Recognition &#40;OCR&#41; software.</p>

			<p>PDF DOWNLOADS &#45; PDFs are available for every title, and the PDF for a whole publication can be downloaded directly using a URL link.</p>

			<p>PAGE IMAGE DOWNLOADS &#45; Images for every page are available and can be downloaded individually in the JPEG format.</p>

			<p>OTHER DOWNLOAD OPTIONS &#45; Currently the bibliographic citation information cannot be downloaded.</p>

			<h2 id="search">Searching</h2>

            <p>We are using <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org">Elasticsearch</a> open source software to index the data in Historical Texts.</p>
			
            <p>To run a search, enter your search terms in the Search box and select the &quot;Search&quot; button. By default, this will search all of the information in the bibliographic records as well as the full text. The search software is not case&#45;sensitive so &quot;Shakespeare&quot; will return the same results as &quot;shakespeare&quot;. The number of matching results will be shown to the right of the Search box.</p>
			
			<p><em>It is worth noting that you can see where in a publication your search terms match using the &quot;Pages&quot; tab in the &quot;Search&quot; panel, within the Viewer &#45; and that you can then search for new terms within the publication using the Search box at the top of the &quot;Pages&quot; tab. <a href="/help#viewer">For more information, see the section on the viewer</a></em>.</p> 
            
			<p>If you do want to limit your search to a particular field e.g. Title you can do so using the drop&#45;down list to the left of the Search box.</p>
			
            <p>The following options are available&#58;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>All</li>
              <li>Title</li>
              <li>Bibliographic number</li>
              <li>Genre</li>
              <li>Text type</li>
            </ul>

			<h2>Building up complex queries</h2>
			
			<p>To build up a complex query you can either type your query into the search box directly using boolean operators or use the add another row feature. Simply select &quot;Advanced Search&quot; on the search page to show additional search features. From here you can add new rows and specify whether your terms MUST, SHOULD or MUST NOT appear in your results.</p>
            
			<p>The first clause of the search &#40;in the main search box&#41; is a MUST &#45; so the results must include whatever goes in that first box. This means that whatever else goes in the search you are essentially starting from a situation where the search in the first box is compulsory. This means that adding a SHOULD clause to this cannot increase the set of results. Adding a SHOULD clause cannot reduce the set of results either &#40;as the clause is optional&#41;.</p>

			<p>This means that adding a SHOULD clause does not change the total number of results. What it does do is re&#45;order the results when using the relevance ranking, so those items matching the SHOULD clauses come to the top.</p>

			<hr />
			
			<h2 id="operators">Operators, Regular Expressions and Reserved Characters </h2>
            
			<h2>Boolean operators</h2>
            
			<p>The familiar Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT &#40;alternatively you can write them as &amp;&amp;, &#124;&#124;, &#33;&#41; are supported and can be entered directly into the search box. NOT takes precedence over AND, which takes precedence over OR and you can combine these operators with brackets. These operators can affect the terms to the left and right of them.</p>
            
			<p>You can also use the preferred Elasticsearch operators &lsquo;&#43;&rsquo; &#40;which means the term MUST be present&#41; and &lsquo;&#45;&rsquo; &#40;which means the term MUST NOT be present&#41;.  These operators can only affect the terms to the right of them.</p>
            
			<p>The example below finds all results for &quot;Shakespeare&quot; without &quot;Venice&quot; in.</p>
            
			<pre>
                Shakespeare -Venice
			</pre>
			
			<p>By default, any terms you enter in the search box MUST be present. For instance, all of the searches below are identical&#58;</p>
            
			<pre>
           	Shakespeare -Venice ode
			</pre>
			
			<pre>
            	&#43;Shakespeare -Venice ode
			</pre>
			
			<pre>
            	&#43;Shakespeare -Venice &#43;ode
			</pre>
			
			<h2>Wild card operators</h2>
            
			<p>Two wild card operators are available&#58;</p>
            
			<pre>
                &#42; &#61; Match any character, including no character
                &#63; &#61; Match any single character&#59; will not match no character
			</pre>
            
			<p>Please avoid wild card characters occurring at or before the third position as they may produce too many unrelated matches.</p>

			<h2>Proximity operators</h2>
            
			<p>Proximity operators enable you to specify the distance &#40;in number of words&#41; your search terms are from each other in the text. You can specify the number using a tilda and a number after the term itself, to widen the proximity increase the number.</p>
            
			<p>The example below finds king and queen within 5 words or less of each other.</p>
            
			<pre>
                &quot;king queen&quot;&#126;5
            </pre>
			
			<h2>Regular expressions</h2>
            
			<p>Searching using regular expressions is supported and terms can be entered directly into the search box wrapped in forward slashes &quot;/&quot;. Historical Texts uses Elasticsearch software to index the data and the full list of <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.7/query-dsl-regexp-query.html#regexp-syntax">supported operators for regular expressions</a> can be found on the Elasticsearch website.</p>
            
			<p>The example below shows a regular expression to look for the word William.</p>
            
			<pre>
                &#47;W&#91;ilam&#93;&#123;0,6&#125;&#47;
            </pre>
            
			<div class="panel panel-default">
				
				<div class="panel-heading">
					<h3 class="panel-title">Regular expressions support</h3>
				</div>
				
				<div class="panel-body"> Support information and tutorials to help you construct regular expressions can be found in a range of places on the web, for example at the <a href="http://regexone.com/">Regex One</a> site and <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html">Regular Expressions Info</a>.
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Reserved characters</h2>
			
			<p>Certain characters function as operators in the system and if you want to use them in your search query, but not as an operator, then you will need to escape them with a leading backslash. </p>
            
			<p>The reserved characters are:</p>
            
			<pre>
                &#43; &#45; &amp;&amp; &#124;&#124; &#33; &#40; &#41; &#123; &#125; &#91; &#93; &#94; &quot; &#126; &#42; &#63; &#58; &#92; &#47;
			</pre>
			
			<h2>Fuzzy searching</h2>
			
			<p>Fuzzy searching enables you to search for terms that are similar to, but not exactly like our search terms.</p>
                
			<p>&quot;Fuzziness&quot; is measured in terms of the number of edits &#40;insertions and deletions&#41; between one term and another. You can specify the number of edits using a tilda and a number after the term itself.</p>
                
			<p>The example below finds &quot;king&quot;, and all other terms within a single edit of the word &quot;king&quot;:</p>
                
			<pre>king&#126;1</pre>
                
			<p>The maximum &quot;fuzziness&quot; supported is 2.
			<br>&#40;obviously you can use the &quot;Fuzzy search&quot; checkbox for fuzzy searching but the operator is also supported in the main search box and allows you to apply the &quot;fuzziness&quot; to only certain terms within your search&#41;</p>
				
			<h2>Variant Forms and Misspelling searching</h2>
				
			<p>Users can also choose options for &quot;Variant Forms&quot;, &quot;Variant Spellings&quot;, &quot;Misspellings&quot; and &quot;Printer Replacements&quot; by clicking the &quot;Fuzzy and Variants&quot; drop&#45;down button and ticking the desired options. 
            
			<br>All the Variant words that are added to the search will appear below the Search bar, colour&#45;coded by Variant type. You can remove Variant words from your search by clicking the &#39;x&#39; at the end of the icon.</p>
                
			<p>We recommend that users not use both the &#39;Fuzzy&#39; and &#39;Variants&#39; options at the same time, as this may yield unpredictable search results.</p>
			
			<a href="../images/support/screenshots/fuzzyvariants-1920OApx.jpg" target="_self"><img src="../images/support/screenshots/fuzzyvariantsOA-700px.jpg" alt="Screen shot of fuzzy and variant drop down menu" title="screenshot showing fuzzy and variant search drop down menu"></a>

			<h2>Grouping</h2>
                
			<p> You can group together terms or search clauses together using parentheses. For example&#58;</p>
                
			<pre>Shakespeare AND &#40;&#40;merchant AND -Venice&#41; OR &#40;king AND lear&#41;&#41;</pre>

			<h2>Field searching</h2>
                  
			<p>You can search specific fields by using the field name followed by a colon then the search term. For example</p>
                
			<pre>title&#95;all&#95;text&#58;Shakespeare</pre>
                
			<p>You can use this in combination with other operators. For example&#58;</p>
                
			<pre>title&#95;all&#95;text&#58;&#40;Shakespeare lear&#41;</pre>
               
			<pre>title&#95;all&#95;text&#58;lear AND author&#95;all&#95;text&#58;Shakespeare&#126;2</pre>

			<p>You can also search for the presence&#47;absence of fields using &#39;&#95;missing&#95;&#39; and &#39;&#95;exists&#95;&#39;. For example to find all texts without edition information&#58;</p>

			<pre>&#95;missing&#95;&#58;publication.edition.statement</pre>

			<p>Bibliographic fields supported in the drop&#45;down Search box menu&#58;</p>

			<ul>
				<li>All&#58; &#95;all</li>
				<li>Title&#58; title&#95;all&#95;text</li>
				<li>Bibliographic number&#58; bibliographic&#95;number</li>
				<li>Genre/Material type&#58; type&#95;or&#95;genre&#95;all&#95;text</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Also dates&#58;</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Earliest publication date for text&#58; lifecycle.publication.date.earliest</li>
				<li>Latest publication date for text&#58; lifecycle.publication.date.latest</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Ranges &#40;numeric, date or text&#41;</h2>
                
			<p>You can search for numeric, date or text ranges. Inclusive ranges are specified with square brackets [min TO max] and exclusive ranges with curly brackets &#123;min TO max&#125;.</p>
                
			<pre>lifecycle.publication.publisher.name.value&#95;text&#58;&#91;aa TO ab&#93;</pre>
                
			<p>The example above would find all texts with a word in the publisher that comes between &quot;aa&quot; and &quot;ab&quot; in alphabetical order including occurrences of &#39;aa&#39; and &#39;ab&#39;. For example it would find the publication statement&#58;</p>
                
			<p>Aat the shop adioyning vnto Saint Mildreds Church in the Pultrye by John Allde </p>
                
			<p>Because of the word &quot;Aat&quot;</p>
                
			<pre>lifecycle.publication.date.earliest&#58;&#91;&#42; TO 1600&#125;</pre>
                
			<p>Finds all texts with an earliest publication date before 1600 &#40;up to 1599&#41;.</p>
                
			<p>More details on <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#_ranges" title="Range searching information on the Elasticsearch website">range searching</a> can be found on the Elasticsearch website. </p>

			<h2>Boosting</h2>

			<p>Boosting can be used to change the relevance ranking based on specific terms in your search &#45; it won&#39;t change the results retrieved, but will change the order. This is done by using the boost operator &#94;. For example&#58;</p>

			<pre>Shakespeare lear&#94;2</pre>

			<p>Will boost the importance of &#39;lear&#39; in the results and so re&#45;order the search set to emphasize those where &#39;lear&#39; appears more often.</p>

			<p>The default boost value is 1, but can be any positive number. A boost value between 0 and 1 reduces relevance of a term.</p>

			<h2>Advanced search</h2>

			<p>More search options are available, but are hidden by default. To show the extra options, click the &quot;Advanced Search&quot; drop&#45;down button to the right of the page.</p>

			<p>The extra options are&#58;</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Filter by date &#45; included undated, exclude undated, undated only, or specify a date or range</li>
				<li>Search on Description only, Full Text Only, or both</li>
				<li>Add rows to introduce additional search terms, using MUST, SHOULD or MUST NOT conditional logic, and searching on any fields available in the normal Search box</li>
				<li>Reset button to clear down the search interface</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				<a href="../images/support/screenshots/advancedsearch-preview-1037px.jpg" target="_self"><img src="../images/support/screenshots/advancedsearch-preview-700px.jpg" alt="screen shot showing advanced search options" title="screen shot showing advanced search options"></a>
			</p>
				
			<h2>Filter by date</h2> <!--check if date changes change this-->
			
			<p>By default, searches will return data from all available date ranges. Clicking the drop&#45;down arrow and selecting the radio button next to the date range field allows users to select from &quot;Including Undated&quot;, &quot;Excluding Undated&quot; or &quot;Undated Only&quot; options.</p>

			<p>&quot;Including Undated&quot; is the default for searching. It also allows for undated records to be included alongside dated records matching a specified range as entered into the date range field &#40;e.g. 1600&#45;1645 plus any undated records matching the other search terms&#41;.</p>

			<p>&quot;Excluding Undated&quot; will return only dated records matching a specified range as entered into the field &#40;e.g. 1600&#45;1645&#41;.</p>
				
			<p>&quot;Undated only&quot; will return only records with no date</p>
				
			<p><em>Please note that the &quot;Including Undated&quot;, &quot;Excluding Undated&quot; and &quot;Undated only&quot; Date Filter options are not available when the Periodicals button is selected.</em></p>

			<p>Individual years can be entered into the date range field, as can hyphenated ranges &#40;e.g. 1600&#45;1645&#41;.</p>

			<p><em>Selecting specific collections in the avanced search options may produce 0 results since only the Burney data is avaible in the labs site. Users can also use the Selector tool on the Histogram to further refine their search results by date range.</em></p>

			<h2>Specify which collection or collections to search on</h2>

			<p>Although the interface allows the selection of different collections, these are not included in the labs site. By default your search will be conducted over the Burney Collection only. Selecting a different collection in the advanced search options may produce 0 results as those collections are not included in the labs data.</p>

			<h2>Search on Description only, Full Text Only, or both</h2>

			<p>By default, Historical Texts searches all full text and bibliographical data available. To restrict your search to only the bibliographic data (and not the full text) of the records, select the &quot;Description&quot; radio button. To search only the full text (and not the bibliographic data) select the &quot;Full Text&quot; radio button.</p>

			<p>Using the &quot;Full Text&quot; button will also ensure that <em>only</em> results with the full text included will be returned.</p>

			<h2>Filter by Illustrated, Not Illustrated, or both</h2>
			
			<p>To restrict your search to records specifically with or without illustrations, expand the Advanced Search options and click the &quot;Illustrated&quot; or &quot;Not Illustrated&quot; radio button as required.</p> 

			<h2>Add rows to introduce additional search terms</h2>

			<p>To build up a complex query you can either type your query into the search box directly using Boolean operators or use the "New Row" feature. Simply select  &quot;Advanced Search&quot; on the search page to show additional search features. From here you can add new rows by clicking the "New Row" button, and specify whether your terms MUST, SHOULD or MUST NOT appear in your results.</p>
            
			<p>The first clause of the search &#40;in the main search box&#41; is a MUST - so the results must include whatever goes in that first box. This means that whatever else goes in the search you are essentially starting from a situation where the search in the first box is compulsory. This means that adding a SHOULD clause to this cannot increase the set of results. Adding a SHOULD clause cannot reduce the set of results either (as the clause is optional).</p>

			<p>This means that adding a SHOULD clause does not change the total number of results. What it does do is re&#45;order the results when using the relevance ranking, so those items matching the SHOULD clauses come to the top.</p>

			<h2>Reset button to clear down the search interface</h2>	
			
			<p>Should you wish to reset the search interface back to the default values, you can click the red &quot;Reset&quot; button at the bottom of the &quot;Advanced Search&quot; options should you wish. Manually setting the values back to their defaults should work equally well.</p> 
			
            <hr />

			<h2 id="browse">Browsing</h2> <!--need updating for Burney as no browse available-->
            
			<p>The browse options in the labs site are designed to browse the standard Historical Texts collections. They browse by author and printer&#47;publisher, two pieces of metadata that are not present in the Burney Newspaper collection.</p>

			<a href="../images/support/screenshots/browse-authOA-1920px.jpg" target="_self"><img src="../images/support/screenshots/browse-authOA-700px.jpg" alt="screen shot showing browse options from tool bar" title="screenshot showing browse options from toolbar"></a>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<p>Please note that the Thomason Tracts data is not accessible in the Burney labs site. To access this, please <a href="https://historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk" target="_self">visit the main Historical Texts site.</a></p>

			<hr>
			
			<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
			
			<h2>Histogram</h2>
			
			<p>Once you&#39;ve run a search on Historical Texts, a Histogram displaying the date range distribution of your results graphically will be shown above your results list. Number of hits is shown on the Y&#45;axis and time in years is shown on the X&#45;axis.
			If you don&#39;t wish to see the Histogram, you can hide it by clicking the upwards&#45;acing arrow on the Date Range tab.</p>
			
            <a href = "../images/support/screenshots/histogramOA-1920px.jpg" target="_self"><img src="../images/support/screenshots/histogramOA-700px.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing the Histogram, with the selector tool" title="Screenshot showing the Histogram, with the selector tool"></a>
			<br>
            <br>      
                  
			<p>You can click and drag within the Histogram to make a further date range selection within your existing results. When you release the mouse, the number of results will be previewed by the scissor icon. Click the scissor icon to confirm the date selection.</p>			
			
			<p>Please note, it is possible to make searches, or date range selections within a search that make the Histogram show a solid block of colour. While it might seem confusing, this is not incorrect - it&#39;s just a reflection of the how the results data has been filtered down.</p> 

			<h2>List view &#45; Grid view</h2>

			<p>Should you wish, you can toggle between a list view or a grid view of your search results by clicking the List or Grid icon buttons, shown next to the &quot;View Mode&quot; legend. When in Grid view, more results are visible on the screen at any one time, so less bibliographic data for each record is displayed by default. When in either view, click &quot;More Information&quot; to see the full bibliographic data for any given result, then &quot;Less Information&quot; to hide it again.</p>

            <h2 id="matchesintext">Viewing search term matches within a text</h2><!--check this works with Burney-->

			<p>Beneath each search result on the results page is a &quot;matches within text&quot; link. Click on this to display pages where your search terms match within the publication. If &quot;Showing 0 matching image&#40;s&#41; out of 0&quot; is displayed instead then this may be due to the matches being in the bibliographic information, for example the title or author, instead of the full text.</p>

            <br>      
            <br>
			
			<p>You can click on a thumbnail or image number to go directly to that page of the text in the viewer. You can also select the thumbnail or title for the publication to open the whole publication in the viewer and select the left hand &quot;Search&quot; panel, then the &quot;Pages&quot; tab to view all of the search term matches as well.</p>
               
            <h2>Burney Periodicals display</h2><!--will need updating-->
			
			<p>Publications that are part of a series are displayed differently, to enable you to quickly identify them and navigate the individual issue you require. If you search for a particular periodical e.g. &lsquo;Mercurius Politicus&rsquo;, you&#39;ll see that there is a bibliographic record for the periodical which has a &lsquo;Series&rsquo; thumbnail. Clicking this thumbnail transfers users to the &lsquo;Periodicals&rsquo; tab on the results page where the list of individual issues will be displayed. You can then select an issue to open in the viewer as usual.</p>
			<p>Individual issues of periodicals are displayed on the &lsquo;Periodicals&rsquo; tab in issue order.</p>

			<h2>Sorting and ordering results</h2>
            
			<p>You can order your search results by Relevance, Date &#40;Ascending&#41;, Date &#40;Descending&#41;, Author &#40;A&#45;Z&#41;, Title &#40;A&#45;Z&#41;. The default value is Relevance.</p>

			<h2>Filtering results</h2>
			
			<p>You can filter down the results of an existing search using the Printer&#47;Publisher, Author, Date, Subject, Text Type and Genre filters on the left hand side of the screen. Note that since only one collection is present in the labs site, the use of the collections filter will have no effect on your results.</p>

			<h2>Number of results displayed</h2>
			
			<p>You can also change the number of results shown per page using the drop&#45;down arrow under the histogram, and navigate through your pages of results with the results navigation toolbar shown at the bottom of each page. You may want to hide the thumbnails on the results page if you are viewing 90 or above results per page as the page will take longer to load with the thumbnails. See the section below on how to do this.</p>

			<h2>Show and hide results page thumbnails</h2>
			
			<p>Results page thumbnails are displayed next to each search result on the results page by default. If you don't want to see them you can use the Thumbnails buttons above the filters on the left hand side of the results page to hide them.</p>
            
			<p>You may wish to do this if you are choosing to view large numbers of results per page e.g. 90 or above, as the page will take longer to load with the thumbnails.</p> 
            
			<p>Please note&#58; this setting only applies to viewing thumbnails on the results page, not the thumbnails in the left hand panel in the viewer for each text.</p>

			<h2 id="viewer">Viewer</h2>

			<p>You can view a screencast about the Viewer and its features here&#58;</p>

			<iframe title="Using the viewer Youtube video" width="700" height="394" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/NZBV0Aty-Co?rel=0&vq=hd720" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

			<p>To view the page images for a text simply select a record from your results list or the browse pages by clicking on the thumbnail or title hyperlink for it. This will open up the viewer, enabling you to view images, full text &#40;where available&#41; and thumbnails side by side. Using the navigation bar at the top of the screen, you can also download individual images &#40;JPEGs&#41; and whole publications &#40;PDFs&#41; and bibliographic citation information &#40;RIS&#41; and get a permanent URL for the publication when viewing an image.</p>

			<p>The viewer is comprised of three panels: a central panel displaying the images and a search panel to the left and a details panel to the right which are collapsed by default. To open the left hand panel select the &quot;Search&quot; button on the left hand side of the viewer and to open the right hand panel select the &quot;Details&quot; button on the right of the viewer as shown in the screenshot below.</p>

			<a href="../images/support/screenshots/viewer-closedOA-1920px.jpg" target="_self"><img src="../images/support/screenshots/viewer-closedOA-700px.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a publication opened in the Viewer, with the side panels closed" title="Screenshot of a publication opened in the Viewer, with the side panels closed"></a>

			<br> 
			<br>
			
			<p>You can have all three panels open at the same time, or just one or two of them and you can re-size the panels by dragging the handle in the middle of the panel edge &#40;highlighted by orange boxes in the screenshot below&#41; to the left or right. To close either panel click on the cross at the top of the panel edges, highlighted by the small orange boxes in the screenshot below.</p>

			<a href="../images/support/screenshots/viewer-openOA-1920px.jpg" target="_self"><img src="../images/support/screenshots/viewer-openOA-700px.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a publication opened in the Viewer, with the both side panels open" title="Screenshot of a publication opened in the Viewer, with the both side panels open"></a>

			<br>
			<br>
			
			<p>The options available on each of the three panels are listed below.</p>

			<h2 id="imagepanel">Image panel</h2>
			
			<p>The central panel in the viewer displays the page images. There is a toolbar on the left hand side of the panel providing the following options&#58;</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Zoom in </li>
                <li>Reset zoom &#40;reset the zoom level so the image is the original default size&#41;</li>
                <li>Zoom out</li>
                <li>Full screen &#40;opens the page image in full screen mode&#41; &#45; please note the Search and Details panels are not available when in full screen view, as this is intended to allow as much screen area to the images as possible.</li>
                <li>Highlight off &#40;feature not available yet but it will hide the search term highlighting&#41;</li>
                <li>Rotate &#40;rotate image by 90 degrees at a time&#41;</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>You can use your mouse wheel or trackpad to zoom in and out instead of using the zoom in&#47;out buttons if you prefer and you can drag the image around using your mouse or trackpad.</p>

			<p>You can navigate through the publication using the navigation toolbar to the bottom of the screen. Here you can move forwards or backwards by page, jump to the start or end of a text, toggle between a single page or two pages reading view, or type a page number in the box and jump directly to that page. These will stay visible even if you switch to the full screen view using the left hand toolbar.</p>

			<h2 id="searchpanel">Search panel </h2>

			<p>To open the search panel, select the &quot;Search&quot; button on the left had side of the viewer. You can re&#45;size the panel by dragging the handle in the middle of the panel edge across to the right and you can close the panel using the cross at the top of the panel edge. There are three tabs providing options for navigating publications:</p>

			<h2 id="pagestab">Pages tab</h2>

			<p>Pages &#45; this lists images matching your search terms so you can select one to jump straight to that image. You can also enter new search terms into the box on the Pages tab to search <em>within the text itself,</em> then click any of the results below to jump to the relevant page in the Image Panel. Note that the success of this may be dependent on the quality of the OCR text. You can order these results in either &quot;Pages Ascending&quot; or &quot;Page Descending&quot; using the drop&#45;down arrow as required as  well as select to search for variants and or illustrated pages using the drop down box beneath the search box.</p>

			<h2 id="thumbstab">Thumbnails tab</h2>

			<p>This tab displays thumbnail images for every image in the publication. 30 are loaded at a time and as you scroll down additional thumbnails will continue to load until you reach the end of the publication. Simply click on a thumbnail image to jump directly to that image in the central viewer panel.</p>

			<a href="../images/support/screenshots/thumb-tabOA-1920px.jpg" target="_self"><img src="../images/support/screenshots/thumb-tabOA-700px.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Thumbnails tab within the Search Panel in the Viewer" title="Screenshot of the Thumbnails tab within the Search Panel in the Viewer"></a>

			<h2 id="pubstab">Publications tab</h2>

			<p>The publications tab displays all of the other publications in Historical Texts that match your search terms, so you can quickly jump to a different publication from within the viewer instead of returning to the results page to select another text.</p>
        
			<a href="../images/support/screenshots/publications-tabOA-1920px.jpg" target="_self"><img src="../images/support/screenshots/publications-tabOA-700px.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Publications tab within the Search Panel in the Viewer" title="Screenshot of the Publications tab within the Search Panel in the Viewer"></a>

			<h2 id="detailspanel">Details panel</h2>

			<p>To open the details panel click on the &quot;details&quot; button on the right hand side of the viewer. You can re&#45;size the panel by dragging the handle in the middle of the panel edge across to the left and you can close the panel using the cross at the top of the panel edge. There are four buttons providing additional information on the publication: details, contents, text and tags.</p>

			<h2 id="detailstab">Details</h2>       

			<p>The details button displays the bibliographic information for a publication.</p>

			<a href="../images/support/screenshots/details-tabOA-1920px.jpg" target="_self"><img src="../images/support/screenshots/details-tabOA-700px.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Details tab within the Details Panel in the Viewer" title="Screenshot of the Details tab within the Details Panel in the Viewer"></a>

			<h2>Contents</h2>

			<p>The table of contents feature is active but improvements will be made to it in due course.</p>

			<h2 id="texttab">Text</h2>

			<p>The text button displays the full text supporting the images, where available. You can also navigate through the publication using the navigation toolbar to the top of this tab. Here you can move forwards or backwards by page, jump to the start or end of a text, toggle between a single page or two pages reading view. This might be preferable for users who primarily want to read from the full text rather than the images.</p>

			<p>Please note that full text is not available for all publications in Historical Texts. Publications with full text present will display a &quot;T&quot; icon in a grey square under the &quot;details&quot; button when the panel is minimized. When full text is not available the full text tab will display the message &quot;Full text not available&quot;.</p>

			<a href="../images/support/screenshots/details-tabOA-1920px.jpg" target="_self"><img src="../images/support/screenshots/text-tabOA-700px.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Text tab within the Details Panel in the Viewer" title="Screenshot of the Text tab within the Details Panel in the Viewer"></a>

			<h2 id="tagstab">Tags</h2>

			<p>The tags button enables you to create and view tags for individual pages within the publication you are viewing. To create a tag open the page you want tag in the viewer and enter a name for the tag in the box at the top of the tags screen and click on the &quot;add tag&quot; button. The tag will be displayed below, along with any other tags you have created in the publication. Click on the page number for any tag to jump directly to that page.</p>

			<p> To view all of your tags for all publications select the &quot;My Texts&quot; then &quot;My Tags&quot; option from the black navigation bar at the top of the screen.</p>

			<p>Please note&#58; The My Tags feature requires logging in with an institutional account via the UK Federation &#40;Shibboleth and OpenAthens&#41; and is not available if you have accessed Historical Texts via IP authentication.</p>

			<h2 id="download">Downloading</h2>

			<p>When you have opened a publication in the viewer, choose the &quot;Download&quot; button and select from a range of download options. The following options are available&#58;</p>

			<ul>
				<li>individual image currently open in the viewer as a JPEG file</li>
				<li>whole publication as a PDF file</li>
				<li>citation information in .RIS format to import into reference management software</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Please note&#58; the Download button is only enabled on the Navigation bar when you have opened a publication in the viewer. On all other pages it is currently disabled and greyed out with a message stating &quot;feature not available&quot; as you can only download a publication when you have selected and opened it.</p>

			<h2 id="stable">Stable URLs </h2>

			<p>The &quot;Share&quot; button on the Navigation bar at the top of the screen provides a stable &#40;permanent&#41; URL for the publication you are viewing for you to copy and paste into your documents or web pages. The button is deactivated and greyed out until you open a publication in the Viewer, at which point it is enabled. When you select the button a stable URL for the publication will copy to the clipboard.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
