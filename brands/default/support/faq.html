            <h2>Are images and full text available for all collections?</h2>
            <p>Images are available for all three of our collections. Full text is available for ECCO, BL and for around a third of EEBO currently. Where full text is available "full text" will be clearly stated under the record on the results page. The data and features available varies by collection as each collection has been provided by a separate content provider. Details of these differences can be found on our <a href="/features/" title="features by collection">features by collection</a> page.</p>

            <h2>Can i download the texts?</h2>
            <p>Yes, you can download the titles in their entirety from all three collections in PDF format or individual images in JPEG format directly within the interface. Simply select a search result from the results list and open it in the viewer, then choose the download icon on the toolbar to download a PDF of the whole publication directly. </p>
            <p> Please note that while PDFs for all three collections are available, only the PDFs for the BL collection are searchable and they have been provided by the British Library.</p>
