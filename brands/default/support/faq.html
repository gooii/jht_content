			<h2>Can subscribing institutions authenticate to Historical Texts via IP address?</h2>
            <p>Yes - providing your institution has a valid subscription to the Historical Texts service, we can set up access via IP address if reequested by your library team. Please be aware that if you authenticate via IP and wish to use the Saved Searched or My Saved Texts features you will be prompted to sign in with your institutional credentials to allow the service to identify you as an individual user.</p>  
			
			<h2>Our institution has a proxy server for use with similar services. Can we use it to access Historical Texts?</h2>
			<p>Yes - you can read more about what is required for the setup on our Librarians page, found <a href="/librarians" title="Librarians Page">here.</a></p>
			
	            <h2>Are images and full text available for all collections?</h2>
            <p>Images are available for all three of our collections. Full text is available for ECCO, BL and for around a third of EEBO currently. Where full text is available "full text" will be clearly stated under the record on the results page. The data and features available varies by collection as each collection has been provided by a separate content provider. Details of these differences can be found on our <a href="/features/" title="features by collection">features by collection</a> page.</p>

			<h2>Can I search within a publication?</h2>
			<p>It is possible to search within a publication provided the full text for it is available. Having opened a publication in the Viewer, click the Search button to open the left-hand panel, and click the Pages tab. From here, you can enter search terms to be run on the current publication. Results for this search will be shown in the panel, and can be ordered by relevance, page ascending or descending using the drop-down arrow. Clicking a result will display the page in question in the Viewer.</p> 
			
            <h2>Can I download the texts?</h2>
            <p>Yes, you can download the titles in their entirety from all three collections in PDF format or individual images in JPEG format directly within the interface. Simply select a search result from the results list and open it in the viewer, then choose the download icon on the toolbar to download a PDF of the whole publication directly. </p>
            <p> Please note that while PDFs for all three collections are available, only the PDFs for the BL collection are searchable and they have been provided by the British Library.</p>
