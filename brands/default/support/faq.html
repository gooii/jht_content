            <h2 id="q1">Can I access Historical Texts&#63;</h2>

            <p>Historical Texts is available via <a href="/about#subscription" title="link to the about page for more information">subscription</a> to UK Higher Education and Further Education institutions and Research Councils who are full members of Jisc Collections. Eligible institutions can request a free 30 day trial of the resource.

			<p>The UK Medical Heritage Library &#40;UKMHL&#41; collection is open&#45;access and free for all to use. It has been integrated into the main platform but the image wall and other extra features can still be accessed in the Labs area, found at&#58; <a href="https://ukmhl.historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk/home">https://ukmhl.historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk/home</a></p>

			<p>If you're still experiencing difficulties, please contact the Historical Texts helpdesk at <a href="mailto:historicaltexts@jisc.ac.uk">historicaltexts&#64;jisc.ac.uk</a>. Please include your institutional affiliation, which computer operating system you are using &#40;e.g.Windows 7, Mac OSX etc&#41;, which web browsing software you are using &#40;e.g.Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer&#41; and details of the route you are using to access the service &#40;e.g. a link from your library service, a wayfless URL etc&#41; and we&#39;ll be in touch to assist.</p>
			
            <h2 id="q3">Do you provide WAYFless URLs&#63;</h2>
            <p>Yes, we provide WAYFless URLs for Historical Texts. </p>
            <p>You can use the <a href="http://wugen.ukfederation.org.uk" title="WAYFless URL generator">WAYFless URL generator &#40;WUGEN&#41; tool</a> to generate one for your institition. </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Go to the <a href="http://wugen.ukfederation.org.uk" title="WAYFless URL generator">WAYFless URL generator &#40;WUGEN&#41; tool</a></li>
            <li>Select your institution as the &quot;Identity Provider&quot;</li> 
            <li>Select &quot;Historical Texts&quot; as the Service Provider</li>
            <li>Accept the default target URL of &quot;https://historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk/&quot;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A WAYFless URL will be displayed for your institution for you to copy or email to yourself.</p>
			
			<h2 id="q4">Can subscribing institutions authenticate to Historical Texts via IP address&#63;</h2>
            <p>Yes - providing your institution has a valid subscription to the Historical Texts service, we can set up access via IP address if requested by your library team. Please be aware that if you authenticate via IP and wish to use the Saved Searched or My Saved Texts features you will be prompted to sign in with your institutional credentials to allow the service to identify you as an individual user.</p>  
			
			<h2 id="q5">Our institution has a proxy server for use with similar services. Can we use it to access Historical Texts&#63;</h2>
			<p>Yes &#45; you can read more about what is required for the setup on our <a href="/librarians/#proxy" title="Librarians Page">Librarians page.</a></p>
			
			<h2 id="q6">How can I access my institution&#39;s usage statistics for the Historical Texts service&#63;</h2>
			<p>Please see the section about usage statistics on our <a href="/librarians/#stats" title="Usage statistics">Librarians page</a></p>
			
	        <h2 id="q7">Are images and full text available for all collections&#63;</h2>
            <p>Images are available for all three of our collections. Full text is available for ECCO, BL and for around a third of EEBO currently. Where full text is available &ldquo;full text&rdquo; will be clearly stated under the record on the results page. The data and features available varies by collection as each collection has been provided by a separate content provider. Details of these differences can be found on our <a href="/help#collections" title="features by collection">Help page.</a></p>

			<h2 id="q8">Can I search within a publication&#63;</h2>
			<p>It is possible to search within a publication provided the full text for it is available. Having opened a publication in the Viewer, click the Search button to open the left&#45;hand panel, and click the Pages tab. From here, you can enter search terms to be run on the current publication. Results for this search will be listed in the panel below the search box, and can be ordered by relevance, page ascending or descending using the drop&#45;down arrow. Clicking a result will open it in the Viewer.</p> 
			
            <h2 id="q9">Can I download the texts&#63;</h2>
            <p>Yes, you can download the titles in their entirety from all three collections in PDF format or individual images in JPEG format directly within the interface. Simply select a search result from the results list and open it in the viewer, then choose the download icon on the toolbar to download a PDF of the whole publication directly. </p>
            <p> Please note that while PDFs for all three collections are available, only the PDFs for the BL collection are searchable and they have been provided by the British Library.</p>
			
			<h2 id="q10">I&#39;ve found an error in the bibliographic data for a publication. What should I do&#63;</h2>
			<p>The bibliographic data was not been catalogued by Jisc so unfortunately we can&#39;t make any direct changes to it. The data was made available to us by another publisher who provide their own online service for ECCO, but they originally received it from the British Library. In future we will be using the bibliographic information provided directly by the English Short Title Catalogue &#40;ESTC&#41; from the British Library though, and any updates to their records will be passed on to us. Bearing this in mind, users are best advised to report the issue to the British Library using the error report form link &#40;at the top of the pages&#41; for these records on the ESTC site.</p>
			
			<h2 id="q11">Are Marc records available for the collections in Historical Texts&#63;</h2>
			<p>Please see the section about Marc records on our <a href="/librarians/#marc" title="Marc records">Librarians page.</a></p>

			<h2 id="q12">The Date Range Histogram results look weird&#63;</h2>
			<p>The histogram represents the distribution of your search results. It's possible to drag&#45;and&#45;click on the graph to make finer selections. It&#39;s possible either with this selection, or by making very specific searches &#40;ones that only yield a single result, for example&#41; to get a solid bar shown on the histogram. As such, it&#39;s not a fault, it&#39;s just a reflection of the results and filtering of your search.</p>

			<h2 id="q13">I've tried to log in and my institution doesn't subscribe to Historical Texts. What can I do&#63;</h2>
			<p>Please see the section about subscriptions on our <a href="/librarians#subs" title="subscriptions">Librarians page</a></p>
			
			<h2 id="q14">Why have I been signed out of Historical Texts unexpectedly&#63;</h2>
			<p>Historical Texts will sign out inactive sessions after an hour, approximately. There are other factors that can also cause you to be signed out unexpectedly that are outside of our domain, including your institutional provider and the route they use to authenticate you, so this cannot be guaranteed as a fixed amount of time. Users are best advised to save any items or searches before leaving their computer for any extended period.</p>

			<h2 id="q15">How do I request permission to reproduce images from EEBO or ECCO&#63;</h2>
			<p>The EEBO data in Historical Texts has been provided by ProQuest and the ECCO data has been provided by Cengage. The copyright for all images is owned by the publishers and so permission to reproduce them must be sought from them.</p>
			<p>You do not need permission to use images from EEBO or ECCO in unpublished works such as theses unless they will be available on the open web or in an institutional repository or other database. Further details on when permission is required can be found on the publisher websites&#58;</p>

				<li>For ECCO check the Cengage website&#58;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cengage.com/permissions/cengage_learning.html" target="_self">http://www.cengage.com/permissions/cengage_learning.html</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2 id="q16">Why are my results greyed out&#63;</h2>
		  
			<p>Since the last open access release in June &#40;which included efforts to make Historical Texts more mobile&#45;friendly&#41; some users have found that Historical Texts now displays in the mobile format when on a full screen. This layout includes a sidebar and the &quot;greying out&quot; of results which appear inaccessible. This can be resolved by clicking on the double chevrons near the thumbnails on&#47;off button, minimising the menu and allowing access to the results.<br>
			  <br>
		
			Some users have found that by changing their screen resolution, the view reverts back to normal.</p>
