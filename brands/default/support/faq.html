			<h2 id="q8">Can I search within a publication&#63;</h2>
			<p>It is possible to search within a publication provided the full text for it is available. Having opened a publication in the Viewer, click the Search button to open the left&#45;hand panel, and click the Pages tab. From here, you can enter search terms to be run on the current publication. Results for this search will be listed in the panel below the search box, and can be ordered by relevance, page ascending or descending using the drop&#45;down arrow. Clicking a result will open it in the Viewer.</p>
			
			<h2 id="q3">Can I browse the Burney collection?</h2>
			<p>The Historical Tests UI &#40;on which this labs site is based&#41; only supports browsing by author or printer&#47;publisher however, this metadata is not present in the Burney collection. To provide users with a browse experience in the labs interface we have created the <a href="https://preview.historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk/titlelist" target="_self">title list page</a> in the about support section. This page simulates a browse by title functionality by applying filters to the collection content.</p>
			
			<p>

			</p>
			
			
            <h2 id="q9">Can I download the texts&#63;</h2>
            <p>Yes, you can download the titles in their entirety from the Burney collection in PDF format or individual images in JPEG format directly within the interface. Simply select a search result from the results list and open it in the viewer, then choose the download icon on the toolbar to download a PDF of the whole publication directly. </p>

			<h2 id="q13">I've tried to log in and my institution doesn't subscribe to Historical Texts. What can I do&#63;</h2>
			<p>Please see the section about subscriptions on our <a href="/https://historicaltexts.jisc.ac.uk/librarians#subs" title="subscriptions">Librarians page of the main site</a></p>
			
			<h2 id="q14">Why have I been signed out of Historical Texts unexpectedly&#63;</h2>
			<p>Historical Texts will sign out inactive sessions after approximately an hour. There are other factors that can also cause you to be signed out unexpectedly that are outside of our domain, including your institutional provider and the route they use to authenticate you, so this cannot be guaranteed as a fixed amount of time. Users are best advised to save any items or searches before leaving their computer for any extended period.</p>

			<h2 id="q15">How do I request permission to reproduce images from the Burney Collection&#63;</h2>
			<p>The Burney Newspaper Collection data in this labs site has been provided by Cengage. The copyright for all images is owned by the publishers and so permission to reproduce them must be sought from them.</p>
			<p>You do not need permission to use images in unpublished works such as theses unless they will be available on the open web or in an institutional repository or other database. To request permission to reproduce a work or to seek more information, contact the publishers directly&#58;</p>
			
			<p>Cengage have an online request form for this purpose. A link to the form can be found on the <a href="https://www.cengage.com/permissions" target="_self">Cengage Rights and Permissions page</a></p>
			
			<h2 id="q16">Why are my results greyed out&#63;</h2>
		  
			<p>Since the last open access release in June &#40;which included efforts to make Historical Texts more mobile&#45;friendly&#41; some users have found that Historical Texts now displays in the mobile format when on a full screen. This layout includes a sidebar and the &quot;greying out&quot; of results which appear inaccessible. This can be resolved by clicking on the double chevrons near the thumbnails on&#47;off button, minimising the menu and allowing access to the results.<br>
			  <br>
		
			Some users have found that by changing their screen resolution, the view reverts back to normal.</p>
